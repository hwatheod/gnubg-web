Introduction =========== GNU Backgammon (gnubg) plays and analyzes
backgammon games and matches. It is able to play and analyze both
money games and tournament matches, evaluate and roll out positions,
and more. Driven by a command-line interface, it displays an ASCII
rendering of a board on text-only terminals, but also allows the user
to play games and manipulate positions with a graphical GTK+
interface. GNU Backgammon is extensible on platforms which support
Python.

GNU Backgammon is a world class opponent and rates at around 2200 on
FIBS, the First Internet Backgammon Server - at its best, it is in the
top 5 of over 6000 rated players there). GNU Backgammon can be played
on numerous other on-line backgammon servers.

The following features can be found in the current release of GNU
Backgammon.

* A command line interface (with full command editing features if GNU
  readline is available) that lets you play matches and sessions
  against GNU Backgammon with a rough ASCII representation of the
  board on text terminals.

* Support for a GTK+ interface with a graphical board window. Both 2D
  and 3D graphics are available.

* Tournament match and money session cube handling and cubeful
  play. All governed by an underlying cubeless money game based
  neuralnet.

* Support for both 1-sided and 2-sided bearoff databases: 1-sided
  bearoff database for 15 checkers on the first 6 points and optional
  2-sided database kept in memory. Optional larger 1-sided and 2-sided
  databases stored on disk.

* Automated rollouts of positions, with lookahead and race variance
  reduction where appropriate. Rollouts may be extended.

* Automatic and manual annotation (analysis and commentary) of games
  and matches.

* Record keeping of statistics of players in games and matches (both
  native inside GNU Backgammon and externally using relational
  databases and Python).

  Game Format).
