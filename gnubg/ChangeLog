	* export.c, import.c: Add a comment in .mat exports of hypergammon
	sessions to indicate variation. Use it on import.

2014-12-04  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	Version 1.04.001 released.

2014-12-04  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* play.c. external.c : Fix external interface bug that prevented
	external socket players from working. Fix bug that prevented
	external socket interface errors being displayed.
	Reported by Philippe Michel. See bug report:
	https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?43747

2014-10-21  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	Version 1.04 released.

2014-09-08  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* eval.c, eval.h: Don't use SanityCheck() on positions evaluated
	with the one-sided database. The latter is more accurate about the
	possibility of a gammon.
	This fixes the issue reported by Michael Petch in
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnubg/2012-10/msg00010.html

2014-09-07  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* gnubg.c: fix re-evaluation of chequer play from the analysis
	panel. It used to clear the skill flag of the associated cube
	decision. Issue reported by Neil Robins to the bug-gnubg list in
	Dec 2012.

2014-08-21  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* import.c: fix a bug introduced July 20th in mat files import
	where some games could have the wrong player set as winner.

2014-08-09  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* rollout.c: declare initial_game_count as volatile. It may be
	updated from multiple threads when multithreading is enabled.
	We don't want an optimizing compiler to optimize this variable away.

2014-08-08  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* configure.ac: modify configure to properly support an argument 
	to --with-python. Supplying a python interpreter as an argument
	will force configure to use the specified one. General Python 
	checking cleanup

2014-08-07  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* configure.ac dbprovider.c gnubgmodule.c gnubgmodule.h 
	m4/az_python.m4 scripts/gnubg.py scripts/db_import.py
	scripts/batch.py scripts/matchseries.py +pylocdefs.h: Support 
	compiling with Python 3.x and modify Python modules to
	support Python 2.x and 3.x.

2014-08-04  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	Version 1.03 released.

2014-07-26  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* analysis.c mtsupport.c play.c: Fix problem with aMoves
	data structures being double freed. This bug would cause
	prgram to crash on termination or crash after stopping an
	analysis.

2014-07-26  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gnubgmodule.c: cfevaluate and evaluate now make asynchronous
	calls to retrieve cube and move results. This allows Python to
	to call these functions from any of its own threads. Fix bug
	with the eval context in PythonEvaluate.

2014-07-25  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* Makefile.am, glib-ext.c, glib-ext.h, gnubg.c, makebearoff.c, 
	  makehyper.c: Modify code to properly compile on systems
	with GLIB < 2.14. Make sure glib threading is initialized
	in enviornments where it is needed. This includes makebearoff
	and makehyper.
	* mtsupport.c, multithread.c, multithread.h: Fix problem with
	mutexes being incorrectly initialized/freed/locked/unlocked
	on environemnts with GLIB >= 2.32. This bug was identified
	with recent GLIB builds with extra runtime checks. See 
	crash reported by Chris Fahlman using unstable Ubuntu. See
	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnubg/+bug/1346567

2014-06-26  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* import.c, show.c, gnubg.c, backgammon.h, set.c, commands.inc:
	Minor changes to the "set aliases" feature from 2014-02-03 after
	users feedback : separator is now ';'
	* doc/gnubgdb.xml: Document the above.

2014-06-23  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* external_y.y, external_l.l, external.c, external.h : Added debug
	command to the external interface limited debugging output support

2014-06-21  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gtklocdefs.c, gtklocdefs.h, glib-ext.h: add g_list_free_full 
	function for environments using glib < 2.28.

2014-06-21  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* drawboard.c, drawboard.h, external.c, external.h, external_l.l,
	  external_y.y, non-src/external_l.c, non-src/external_y.c, 
	  non-src/external_y.h	
	Replace the external interface with a reentrant version that is
	more extensible for storing more complex datatypes in the future.
	Yacc will no longer compile, as it uses Bison extensions. The
	external interface is compatible with the previous version although
	the error messages have changed. Added new command "quit" that allows
	a remote session to close the connection. A new "Version" command will
	return the version of the external interface. The "Noise" option was
	broken. Noise can work with an integer (divide by 10000 to get a
	noise value). Noise also supports a float type where the value
	represents the actual noise value. The evaluation and session options 
	can now appear in any order. Player names can now be quoted strings.
	When a remote session is connected a single control-c rather than 2 
	will return to the gnubg command line. A bug that made a blank line
	execute the previous command has been fixed. Now an error message is
	displayed.

2014-06-21  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* +glib-ext.c, +glib-ext.h, Makefile.am Makefile.w32: Add GLIB 
	utility functions and macros to provide extra list functionality and 
	string to GValue maps.

2014-05-26  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* import.c: Fix interpretation of eXtreme Gammon's "; Set Pos=..."
	extension to mat format. Non-centered cubes were set to the wrong side.

2014-03-31  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gtkprefs.c: Fix problem with some build environments that
	incorrectly encoded and decoded some board appearance colours.
	This fix was provided by Jon Kinsey via Tom Martin to fix problems
	changing between 2D board designs on the MinGW(Win32) builds.

2014-03-09  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* gtkgame.c: Use terser format (one line only) when copying GNUbg
	ID. Fixes bug #27716.

2014-02-26  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gnubgmodule.c, backgammon.h: More Python module cleanup.  Add
	basic support for move filters. Initial support for eval/hint
	filters. Modify findbestmove to use a user supplied move filter.
	Add new function calcgammonprice.  TODO: Create a method to
	retrieve a filter by name.  Create a method to get/set analysis
	filter

2014-02-25  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gnubgmodule.c, backgammon.h, gnubg.c: Convert error related
	printf's to Python Errors. If a user interrupt occurs during a
	Python operation then reset the interrupt handling. Modify
	gnubg.findbestmove function to utilize asynchronous processing to
	help avoid thread issues when called from Python.

2014-02-12  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* html.c: Clean up headers in positions copied as GammOnLine HTML.
	Issue mentionned by Stick in the bgonline forum.

2014-02-11  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gnubgmodule.c: Modify findbestmove to use the user selected
	analysis level when no evaluation context is passed as a parameter.
	* import.c: Fix missing GStatBuf type on Win32 platforms
	* configure.ac: Moving towards release 1.03.000. Fix problem
	detecting GLU on WIN32 platform
	* gtklocdefs.h: Fix problem with GtkComboBoxText type on GTK < 2.24

2014-02-03  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* gnubg.c, backgammon.h, commands.inc, import.c, set.c, show.c:
	Add "set aliases <nickname1>:<nickname2>:<etc...>" command to list
	player names that should always be set as player 1 (bottom player)
	when importing a MAT file. This setting is only available in the
	CLI for now. Add related "show aliases" command.

2014-01-13 Jon Kinsey <Jon_Kinsey@hotmail.com>

	* gtkprefs.c: Fix some board design bugs: switching 2d wood paint
	setting, invalid xml characters in design name/description, reduce
	wrong pop-up about losing design (Thanks to Tom Martin for
	reports).

2014-01-12  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* import.c: Interpret eXtreme Gammon's "; Set Pos=..." extension
	to mat format.
	For now, games or matches containing this kind of record cannot be
	re-exported to mat or Snowie txt format.

2013-11-30  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* gtkgame.c: Display match statistics when a match analysis is
	completed (GUI only, and does not apply to those run from a
	command file or a batch analysis).

2013-11-26  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gnubgmodule.c: Fix a serious bug created by a previous commit
	that prevented many of the python interface function from working
	correctly. Add new classifypos python function to the gnubg python
	interface.

2013-11-12  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* README, backgammon.h, commands.inc, file.c, file.h, import.c,
	doc/gnubgdb.xml: Remove support of Berliner's BKG format.

	* gnubg.c: Include pip counts in positions copied to clipboard
	as ASCII.

2013-10-25  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* eval.c: Show the weights file and bearoff databases installation
	directory in Help|About GNU Backgammon|Evaluation Engine or "show
	engine" output.

2013-10-20  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* file.c: Fix automatic import of mat files starting with many
	comment lines (Backgammon NJ can create such files).

2013-09-22  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* gnubg.c, gtkgame.c (comment only): Fix assertion failure when
	asking for a hint on a resignation while reviewing a game.
	Reported via Debian bugs tracker and Russ Allbery.
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnubg/2013-09/msg00006.html

2013-08-20  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* boards.xml, gnubg.gtkrc, gnubg.sql, met/met.dtd, met/met.xsl,
      scripts/batch.py, scripts/batch_win.py, scripts/database.py,
      scripts/db_import.py, scripts/gnubg.py, scripts/matchseries.py:
	Update license information.

2013-08-20  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* +doc/bearoffdump.6, +doc/makebearoff.6, +doc/makehyper.6,
	  +doc/makeweights.6, doc/Makefile.am, Makefile.am:
	Add man pages for the GNUBG utilities, based upon the man pages
	created by Russ Allbery for Debian/GNU Linux. Fix docdir usage,
	and compress the man pages.

2013-08-20  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* configure.ac: Apply patch provided by Christopher Hofmann.
	Autoconf now checks for the GLU library when building with
	3D boards.
	* mkinstalldirs: Update to a newer version from automake-1.14

2013-07-28  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	Version 1.02 released.

2013-07-22  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* configure.ac, openurl.c: Add a configure option 
	--with-default-browser to override the default value "xdg-open".
	if --with-default-browser is specified without an argument
	it will look for a default in this order sensible-browser, 
	xdg-open, firefox . If none are found the default xdg-open 
	will be used. This option is not available on Win32 platforms.

	Add a new configure option --enable-gasserts . Previously
	g_assert macros have been enabled by default. They are now 
	disabled by default. This option is used to enable those
	macros. 

	Take the AVX code out of the experimental stage. If AVX is
	supported on the processor and OS then it will be used by default.

2013-07-22  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gtk-multiview.c, gtk-multiview.h, mec.c, sound.c, board3d/tr.c, 
	board3d/tr.h, lib/mm_malloc.h: Fix some licensing inconsistencies
	identified by Russ Allbery.

2013-07-21  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gnubg.c: When displaying "save settings to" attempt to output the 
	message immediately. This prevents some unnecessary popup messages.

2013-07-20  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* multithread.c: Fix bug on thread disabled builds that caused
	an assertion while updating the progress bar. Ensure the callback
	timer is removed when all tasks are done.

2013-07-20  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* eval.c lib/neuralnet.c, lib/neuralnet.h: Remedy a bug that
	produced inconsistent results when producing non-SIMD builds. Make
	sure that EvaluateFromBase is using comparable nets when using a
	neural net shortcut.

2013-07-17  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* analysis.c, dbprovider.c, eval.c, gnubgmodule.c, gnubgmodule.h,
	  multithread.c, lib/inputs.c, lib/neuralnetsse.c, lib/simd.h:
	Fix stack issues that cause AVX WIN32 builds to segfault when 
	optimizations are used. 

2013-07-17  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* sound.c: Allow GNUBG to build on OS/X builds using the CLang
	compiler. CLang supports AVX instructions. GCC shipped by Apple
	is based upon the older 4.2 version of GCC.

2013-07-12  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* sound.c: On systems using libcanberra it is possible that the
	canberra sound system may be available, but disabled by default.
	When the sound context is created enable the canberra sound
	system explicitly. Bug report (and patch) received from
	Dan Fandrich. See:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnubg/2013-07/msg00008.html

2013-07-11  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gnubg.c, utils.h, utils.c: Added a new command line option
	'-s <path>' to specify the location of the user's GNUBG preferences
	directory. This overrides the default location of $(HOME)/.gnubg .
	If you wish to save your settings to the directory that GNUBG 
	was run from then use '-s .'

2013-07-10  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gtkgame.c: Fixed bug that prevented the stop button in the
	status bar from being active.

2013-07-10  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* +mtsupport.c, Makefile.am, Makefile.w32, bearoffdump.c,
	   makebearoff.c, makehyper.c, multithread.c, multithread.h:
	Reduce the cpu cycle overhead of the new heap allocated thread 
	local data. Rework the multithreaded code. Split multithreaded
	support functions out of multithread.c and into mtsupport.c . 
	mtsupport.c can be used by the utiltity programs (makebearoff etc).

2013-07-08  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* Makefile.am, bearoffdump.c, eval.c, eval.h, gnubg.c,
	  makebearoff.c, makehyper.c multithread.c multithread.h 
	  po/*: Move static thread local data from eval.c into
	thread local storage (multithread.c). This reduces the
	bss data size. Thread storage is allocated on the heap
	as required. Ensure that the data is properly aligned for
	SIMD usage.

2013-07-06  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* lib/inputs.c, lib/simd.h, Makefile.am, configure.ac: Fix an 
	AVX alignment bug while creating the baseinputs for the NN on
	Win32 platforms with GNUC.
	
	* eval.c, gnubgmodule.c, multithread.c, multithread.h,
	m4/ax_ext.m4: Fix some warnings and general cleanup

2013-06-29  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* backgammon.h, gnubg.c, gnubgmodule.c: Added preliminary 
	support for Python module function 'hint'. Work in progress
	The function interface and the dictionary returned may change.
	Added module functions mwc2eq_stderr and eq2mwc_stderr.

	Inefficient memory use for eval and rollout contexts should be 
	cleaned up. Rollout contexts should include all the cube and 
	chequer play sub contexts. The hint dictionary needs to be
	documented.

2013-06-25  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* backgammon.h, gnubg.c, play.c: hint_move has been modified to 
	support external callbacks. Part of future Python integration.

2013-06-25  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* eval.c, lib/neuralnet.c: If SIMD instructions are compiled in
	and they are not supported by the processor, output an error 
	message and then terminate immediately.

2013-06-22  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* INSTALL, configure.ac, eval.c, gnubg.c, gnubg.spec, 
	  po/POTFILES.in
	Rename file sse.h to simd.h. Rename USE_SSE_VECTORIZE to 
	USE_SIMD_INSTRUCTIONS, rename SSE_Supported to SIMD_Supported,
	rename DISABLE_SSE_TEST to DISABLE_SIMD_TEST,
	rename SSE_CFLAGS to SIMD_CFLAGS

	Make sse/simd usage more consistent, ./configure option
	--enable-sse/--disable-sse is now --enable-simd/--disable-simd

2013-06-20  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* +m4/ax_check_compile_flag.m4, +m4/ax_ext.m4 
	+m4/ax_gcc_x86_avx_xgetbv.m4 +m4/ax_gcc_x86_cpuid.m4,
	configure.ac: Added better autoconf support to determine 
	whether the processor supports certain SIMD instruction sets
	like SSE,SSE2,AVX etc.

	--enable-simd behaves a bit different. --enable-simd with no
	parameters is the same as --enable-simd=yes . The behavior of
	--enable-simd=yes has been changed to find the latest supported
	SIMD instruction set used by the build machines CPU. Priority
	is given in this order (highest first): SSE2, SSE, AVX, None.
	Since AVX is still experimental it is not given priority over
	SSE2 during build time autodetection.

2013-06-19  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* +output.c +output.h, gnubg.c, backgammon.h, lib/Makefile.am
	lib/neuralnet.c: Moved the output functions from gnubg.c to
	their own files.

2013-06-19  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gnubg.c, eval.c, lib/neuralnet.c, lib/neuralnet.h,
	configure.ac: Add support for plm's new AVX instruction
	additions. Separate the cputest from the --enable-simd
	configure option. Created a new option --disable-cputest. 

	Supports cputest functionality on GCC builds with either
	64-bit or 32-Bit OSes on Intel processors. Code will work
	with builds that use -fpic option.

2013-06-18  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gnubg.c: When using the -r flag to start GNUBG (start without 
	reading the gnubgautorc file), the gnugbautorc file will be
	overwritten with defaults if running with the GUI. Reported
	by plm, see: https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?38497#postcomment

2013-06-17  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gtkgame.c: Fix language bug that prevented the GUI from properly
	refreshing the screen when a new Language was chosen

	* Makefile.am: Win32 builds have a localedir of ./locale relative
	to the executables directory. A bug had newer windows builds 
	seeking locale files in the default locations which was incorrect,
	and consquently language translation didn't occur.

2013-06-15  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* All .c and .h files: Standardized the code formatting with
	indent -kr -l120 -fc1 -sc -nut -psl . K&R style, 120 column limit
	process comment in column 1, multiline comments have an asterisk 
	at the beginning of each line, convert all tabs to spaces, and
	split the return type of a function from the function name
	(each on their own line). K&R uses 4 spaces for an indentation
	level. Update the language files.

	* script/*.py : Reformat the python files to conform to PEP8 
	standard. See http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#indentation

2013-06-15  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gnubgmodule.c, scripts/gnubg.py: Modify the python interpreter
	processing so that it falls back to a simple command line
	interface on older versions of Windows (Versions before WinXP SP2).
	Fix segfault related to launching the Python command line 
	interpreter

2013-06-15  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* configure.ac, lib/neuralnetsse.c, lib/sse.h, lib/inputs.c: Use
	AVX instructions when built with "configure --enable-simd=avx"

2013-06-13  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gtkprefs.c: Save board preferences when clicking "OK"
	on the board appearance configuration dialog.

2013-06-12  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* dbprovider.c, dbprovider.h, gtkrelational.c, relational.c,
	  scripts/database.py : Allow hostname to be specified
	in the database connection dialog box. Hostnames can be
	any valid combination of hostname:portnumber

2013-06-07  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gtkwindows.c, play.c: Fix a bug that segfaulted the "end game"
	command when built with GTK and the "-t" option is used to
	launch GNUBG.

2013-06-06  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gnubgmodule.c, gnubgmodule.h, gtkgame.c, scripts/gnubg.py: Move
	loading of the Python command line interpreter to Python functions
	in gnubg.py. The Python command line now supports IPython if
	present. IPython takes precedence over the standard Python 
	interpreter. If the standard interpreter is used, attempt to
	load command history (readline module) and then try loading
	auto completion (rlcompleter module) support if present. 	

	Fix Python related ifdefs to allow compiling when built without 
	Python support.

2013-06-05  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* scripts/gnubg.py: Add the scripts directory to the Python path
	so that files in the directory can be imported.

2013-06-05  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gnubgmodule.c, gtkgame.c, play.c: Modify the interactive Python 
	interpreter to support tab completion and command history. Begin
	reintroducing Python IDLE, since it functions on MS Windows and
	various linux distros. Ubuntu/Debian installation of IDLE can be 
	done via: apt-get install idle . If IDLE is not present it will
	drop back to the old method. CLI builds don't use IDLE at present.
	IDLE is not on the GUI menu but can be activated by turning on the
	"command" pane and entering '>' (greater than sign without quotes)
	as a command. IF IDLE is not presnt and usable it will do nothing.
	This is a work in progress.

2013-06-04  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gtkrelational.c: Don't allow a user to create a player database 
	that already exists.

	* dbprovider.h, dbprovider.c, scripts/database.py, gnubgmodule.c:
	Add Mysql support on Win32 platforms using pymysql (a purely
	python based database driver for mysql)

2013-06-04  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* configure.ac, multithread.h: Allow a new autoconf/configure 
	parameter --with-eval-max-threads=size to allow the maximum number of
	evaluation threads to be specified. Default is 48 if not specified.

	* dbprovider.h, dbprovider.c, relational.c scripts/database.py:
	Fix bugs that prevented proper connections and database usage 
	when using the Mysql and Postgres player database providers. 
	Mysql and Postgres are unsupported on the MS Windows platform - 
	Disable them in the GUI

2013-05-31  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* play.c: Under certain situations (load commands from a file 
	containing a play command within the GUI) would stop
	on an assertion. PlayCommand not properly resetting the
	notification handler. Reported by Ian Shaw

2013-05-28  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gnubg.c: Fix bugs related to python handling of
	ParseMove and FormatMove . Fix bug that would cause crash when 
	command "load commands" used unquoted filenames on Win32 platform.
	Reported by Ian Shaw

2013-05-17  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* configure.ac eval.h gnubg.weights doc/gnubgdb.xml
	  doc/gnubg/* doc/gnubgman.xml: Version bumped to V1.00.0 .

	* gnubg.c: Change default MET to Kazaross-XG2.xml

2013-04-13  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* import.c: Interpret some of the comments eXtreme Gammon puts at
	the start of .mat files to fill match information in and determine
	game variation.
	* export.c: Writes similar comments when exporting as .mat

2013-03-26  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* matchequity.c: Recalculate gammon prices after inverting the MET.
	This is needed for asymetric tables. Problem reported by Maik Stiebler
	in bug-gnubg.

2013-03-15  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* doc/gnubg/* doc/gnubgdb.xml doc/gnubgman.xml: Version
	bumped to V0.91.0 in the documentation.

2013-03-07  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* gnubg.c: Use stronger default settings for Computer opponent,
	Tutor and Analysis (2 ply instead of 0 ply) and for rollouts (0 ply
	checker play and 2 ply cube instead of 0 ply for everything).
	Increase the default JSDs and minimum trials to stop a rollout early.

	* eval.c: Use SSE instructions, if available, in the pruning nets
	computations. This is a small speed improvement but constrains the
	size of the pruning nets' intermediate layer to be a multiple of 4.

2013-03-06  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* configure.ac, credits.sh, eval.h, gnubg.weights: New nets.
	Version bumped to 0.91.

2013-02-17  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* format.c: Use EMG by default in matchplay analysis output since
	these numbers are generally easier to interpret than MWC.

2013-01-23  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* simpleboard.c, simpleboard.h, export.c: Improve export of
	positions in cairo graphics. Problem reported by Leo Bueno.

2012-10-25  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gnubgmodule.c : Add movetupletostring method to the Python
	interface. Added support for tuples generated by findbestmove
	and parsemove.

2012-10-23  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gnubgmodule.c : recent removal of reduced dict item from the 
	Python eval contexts introduced a bug that produced an error
	processing the noise dict item. Reported by Bagrat Lazaryan

2012-10-21  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* play.c, gnubgmodule.c : Fix issue with GNUBG not resigning if the 
	opponent is guaranteed to win a backgammon or a gammon. Discovered 
	in matches played by Murat (R.G.B).  Add number of points resigned 
	(1=regular,2=gammon,3=backgammon) to Python resign dictionary item.

2012-10-20  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* analysis.c, gtkpanels.c : Fix issues with crawford games. If
	not using "automatically start next game" and you analyse a game
	or match in the game preceding the crawford game the next game
	will not be treated as a crawford game.
	See: https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?35179

	Fixed bug with the Crawford flag beneath the board not being 
	properly set when Crawford game is reached.

2012-10-19  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gtkprefs.c, renderprefs.c, set.c : Export of positions/matches
	didn't honour the board styles when GNUBG launched with -t
	or was built with --without-gtk option. Reported by Fredrik.
	See: http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnubg/2012-10/msg00011.html

2012-10-19  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gnubgmodule.c, gnubgmodule.h : Stack alignment issue.
	On Win32/GCC builds, SSE instructions acting on variables
	allocated on the stack in Python code would cause a segfault.
	Properly align stack in Python functions that may call SSE
	code. Reported by bagratte. See https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?37583 

2012-10-18  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* play.c : Murat (R.G.B) noticed that resignations acted differently 
	in some cases. Found that resignations can be analysed in 0 ply in 
	some places and 2 ply in others. To remain consistent we now compute 
	them at 0 ply.

2012-10-11  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* import.c : Fix BGRoom import bug reported by Adi Kadmon where 
	player names were not properly applied to Player 1 and 
	Player 2 (They could be reversed).

2012-10-11  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* configure.ac : Configure process modified to support a thread type 
	with --enable-threads default threading is glib threads. 
	Supports win32, glib and no threading

2012-10-08  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* configure.in: This file name is deprecated, rename it to
	configure.ac.

2012-10-07  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* backgammon.h, gnubg.c, configure.in : Convert BUILD_DATE
	define to literal string before usage. Allow VERSION_EXT
	environment variable to be passed to autogen.sh to specify an
	extension on a version number. VERSION_EXT="-mingw" 
	would yield a version that would appear as 0.90.0-mingw .	

2012-10-07  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* +win32/*, pixmaps/Makefile.am, configure.in, Makefile.am: 
	Added WIN32 resource support (icons etc), and general
	automake cleanup 

2012-09-18  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* backgammon.h, dice.c, gnubg.c, gtkoptions.c, set.c,
	  lib/mt19937ar.c lib/mt19937ar.h

	Better Mersenne Twister seed support when compiled with libgmp.
	MT Seeds with libgmp support can be full range from 0 to 2^19973-1. To
	retain backward comaptibility with rolls generated from seeds between
	0 and 2^32-1 on previous releases of GNUBG, seeds in this range will 
	be set using the old method.

	GUI modified to support a seed value between 0 and 2^32-1 instead
	of 2^31-1

	When libgmp support is absent we now support unsigned 32 bit integers
	rather than signed. When compiling 64bit (without libgmp), seeds
	will be limited to 32 bit integers. Compile with libgmp to support
	seeds greater than 32 bits.

	Note: In previous releases, if libgmp support was present, seeds 
	exceeding 2^32-1 did not work as expected even though the seed 
	appeared to be successfully set.

2012-08-05  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gtkchequer.c: Fix string buffer over run when copying
	move analysis data. Reported by Mike Mannon, see bug 
	http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?37025. TODO: introduce a better
	way to allocate space for the text buffer.

2012-08-01  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* import.c: Fix some import problems with files exported by
	eXtreme Gammon and GridGammon.

2012-07-01  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gnubg.c: Added a define NO_OVERLAYSCROLLBARS that can be
	used to override LIB_OVERLAYSCROLLBARS to be 0 on platforms
	where overlay scrollbars currently cause problems. The long
	term fix is to replace GtkCList with GtkTreeview. mdpetch
	is curretly working on this solution. More information on this
	problem can be found at:
	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnubg/+bug/1002063

2012-06-21  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gtkboard.c: Fix bug reported by motiv4u and Tim Chow that
	caused edit mode to act oddly when the player on roll is changed.

2012-05-15  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* play.c: Fix bug reported on R.G.B. by murat that prevented
	the GUI from navigating to the next game when a resignation
	is offered and the "End Game" feature is used. The issue only
	occurred in 3D view.

2012-05-04 Jon Kinsey <Jon_Kinsey@hotmail.com>

	* drawboard3d.c: remove no longer needed board resize when cube moves
	to top of screen.

2012-03-03  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* eval.c: Improve backgammons estimation in race pruning by using
	the same method than in the regular evaluation.

2011-12-31  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* lib/neuralnetsse.c: Fixes error in sigmoid approximation when
	using SSE instructions. This will cause occasional small
	discrepancies in evalation output compared to previous code.

2011-12-07  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* dice.c: fix small modulo bias in dice generation with some
	RNGs. Affects ansi, bsd, isaac, md5 and mersenne.

	As a consequence, a match or session started with the same seed
	can very occasionally unfold differently from how it did before
	the change. Rollouts using the same seed can give a marginally
	different result as well. The probability of the dice sequence
	diverging at each roll is on the order of 1 in 1,000,000,000.

Mon Oct 31 12:22:59 CET 2011 Christian Anthon <anthon@kiku.dk>

	* gtklocdefs.c, gtklocdefs.h, m4/Makefile.am
	m4/versioncompare.m4: compile on centos5

Mon Oct 31 10:40:01 CET 2011 Christian Anthon <anthon@kiku.dk>

	* analysis.c, backgammon.h, export.c, format.c, gtkboard.c, gtkgame.c,
	gtkgame.h, gtklocdefs.c, gtkpanels.c, gtktheory.c, import.c,
	makebearoff.c, play.c, set.c, sgf.c, board3d/graph.c,
	board3d/widget3d.c, lib/inputs.c: silence compiler warnings from gcc

2011-09-29  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* html.c: BBS Match output rendered with white space
	when outputting a complete match. Rendering problem
	was because Strict XHTML DocType. Reported by Chris Yep
	BBS output cleaned up to validate properly as 
	Strict XHTML 1.0.

2011-09-08  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* import.c: Don't replace spaces by underscores in players' names
	while importing.

2011-09-02  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gtkboard.c, gtkfile.c, gtkgame.c, gtklocdefs.c,
	  gtklocdefs.h, gtktoolbar.c, gtktoolbar.h, gtkwindows.c:
	Work around more deprecated functions.

2011-08-30  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* Makefile.am, credits.sh gtk-multiview.c, gtkboard.c,
	  gtkexport.c, gtkgame.c, gtkgame.h, gtkgamelist.c,
	  gtkmovefilter.c, gtkmovefilter.h, gtkmovelist.c,
	  gtkmovelistctrl.c, gtkoptions.c, gtkpanels.c,
	  gtkprefs.c, gtkrace.c, gtksplash.c, gtktempmap.c,
	  gtktheory.c, gtktoolbar.c, gtktoolbar.h, gtkwindows.c,
	  set.c, board3d/graph.c, board3d/gtkcolour3d.c,
	  board3d/inc3d.h, board3d/misc3d.c, board3d/widget3d.c,
	  +gtklocdefs.h, +gtklocdefs.c, +gtkuidefs.h:
	Work around deprecated functions in GTK 2.24,
	remove direct member access of opaque types,
	convert GtkItemFactory to GtkUIManager for the menu
	and toolbars. Building with 2.24 using compile flags
	-DGDK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED -DGTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED
	-DGSEAL_ENABLE is a first step to supporting GTK3.
	Keep the code backward compatible with GTK 2.6 with
	conditional expressions.

	The above DISABLE_DEPRECATED flags are intrusive and may not allow
	to build a working gnubg on some platforms. When simply making
	changes to the menus and toolbars, it is enough to check that they
	work with -DUSE_GTKUIMANAGER -DGSEAL_ENABLE as well as without
	these flags.

2011-08-24  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* met/Kazaross-XG2.xml: Add XG2 MET generated by Neil Kazaross

2011-08-21  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gtkchequer.c,gtkcube.c: Fixed bug #33781. When doing a
	chequer play rollout from the hint window, destroy the rollout
	window when the user hits "Stop" or the rollout finishes.
	This is the same behavior as doing "Rollout" from the move
	list in the game record pane. Fix similar issue with cube rollout.
	Please see https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?33781
	for additional comments and other coding options to resolve
	these issues

2011-08-20  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* eval.c: Improve evaluation of late bearoff positions in match
	play. Problem reported by Neil Robins (in 2009). 0- and 1-ply can
	still be way off if there is an impending automatic redouble but
	evaluations with deeper lookahead should be adequate.

2011-08-20  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gnubg.c: Fixed bug #33781. When doing a chequer play rollout
	from the hint window, detroy the rollout window when the user
	hits "Stop" or the rollout finishes. This is the same behavior
	as doing "Rollout" from the move list in the game record pane.

2011-08-20  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gnubg.c: Fixed bug #33141. Under Windows convert file name
	from locale to utf8 to handle special characters in file names.

2011-08-19  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* set.c: Fixed bug reported by Chris Yep. If you use "hint"
	on a Crawford position, edit the position and remove Crawford
	flag, and click "Hint" it used the previous position info and
	produced identical results. Also occurred if using
	"set crawford" command directly.

2011-08-18  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* configure.in, Makefile.am, gnubgmodule.c: Fixed build issues
	with Mingw/Msys environment. MingW doesn't output Binary data 
	by default to stdout. Use makeweights "-f" argument to output
	proper binary weights files. On Windows path names need to be
	properly escaped when passed to the Python interpreter.

2011-08-16  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* sound.c, configure.in: Play CoreAudio sounds in the
	background on OS/X builds. Deficiency found by Louis Zulli. 

2011-08-16  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* sound.c, configure.in: Play CoreAudio sounds in the
	background on OS/X builds. Deficiency found by Louis Zulli. 

2011-08-16  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* eval.c, eval.h: Add 4ply with large movefilter to predefined
	play levels. Bump grandmaster movefilter up to large.

2011-08-15  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* Makefile.am, configure.in, util.c, board3d/Makefile.am, 
	doc/Makefile.am: better support for Mingw/Msys windows
	builds.

2011-08-12  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* play.c, gtkgame.c, gtkboard.c: Fixed bug #33866 reported by 
	Gerhard. In 3D mode with option "Start new Games immediately" 
	turned off, match would not continue properly if the computer
	offered a resignation. Also fixes the bug where the resignation 
	flag is not cleared after accepting/rejecting a resignation.
	Fixed Bug #33701, #33313 - When "Start Game Immediately" option
	is off, resigning gets the user stuck trying to start a new 
	game. Now allow user to click dice area on board to start new 
	game after a resign. 	

2011-08-11  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* set.c: When importing XGIDs prompt user in positions where
	person on roll is on top before swapping. In non interactive
	mode swapping will not occur. This option exists because XG2
	swaps players when exporting (default), so person on roll
	appears on bottom. Unfortunately, XG2 does not change the XGID
	to account for the change.

2011-08-09  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* play.c, gtkoptions.c: A new bug was introduced that broke
	canceling of a match where bot played bot (or potentially other
	scenario of automatic play). Fixed an old bug where canceling 
	automated bearoff of the human didn't work properly. Cache size 
	is now reported as MB (Megabyte) not "Mb" (Megabit) 	

2011-08-07  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* set.c: Some imported XGID cube positions were not properly
	swapped when the board was displayed. Reported by Philippe (plm)

2011-08-07  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* play.c: Fixed bug #33143 reported by Kevin McDonough where 
	interrupting a forced move in 2D got into wrong state causing
	bot not to continue automatic play.

2011-08-03  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gnubgmodule.c: Add PythonParseMove function

2011-08-03  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* set.c: Fixed the display of the board when importing XGID's
	so that they appear *similar* to those HTML positions pasted to
	websites. Reported by Leo Bueno (on BGO). Assume that most
	people are using XG2 and exporting with default setting "Player
	on roll always at the bottom".

2011-08-03  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* gnubg.c, gtkboard.c, play.c, set.c: More fixes to swap players
	feature.

2011-08-01  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* play.c, gnubg.c, set.c: Fixed display of SETBOARD records in the
	game record panel (bug #32778). Fixed Game|Swap players for games
	ending with a SETBOARD record (in practice, games created from a
	pasted id).

2011-07-29  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* analysis.c: Previous getLuckRating change had unintended side
	effects when we stopped using hard coded values. Hard coded values
	were off by an approximate factor of 10. Although this has been fixed
	it may wish to be revisited as to why the values were hardcoded in
	this fashion originally. Reported by Chris (pck).

2011-07-17  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gnubgmodule.c: Fixed Python position key functions to internally call 
	the old style position keys functions. Fixes compiler errors due to 
	new position key changes made on 2011/07/15.

2011-07-15  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* positionid.c, positionid.h, lib/cache.c, lib/gnubg-types.h: Use
	a simpler position key for internal use. PositionKey() and
	PositionFromKey() are much faster. The global speed improvement is
	about 10%.
	A side effect is that the evalution cache becomes 38% larger.

2011-07-09  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* gnubg.c, gtkgame.c: Set players names from default_names at
	program launch and when pasting a position id, in addition to when
	starting a match.

2011-07-08  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* play.c: Update players names in game record panel when starting
	a new match.

2011-06-13  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* analysis.c: getLuckRating was returning values based
	on old hard coded luck thresholds. Use the user supplied 
	ones instead 

2011-06-08  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gnubgmodule.c: Add new python function "DiceRolls" to 
	return the next "n" rolls from the current RNG. 

2011-05-18  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* configure.in:  --enable-threads and --enable-extmatchid are 
	now the default. amd64 cpu types will automatically enable sse2

2011-05-17  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gtkgame.c: Modify the Menu to support copying of GNUBGID's,
	as well as the MatchId or positionID's individually.

2011-05-17  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* configure.in: Modify the ./configure process to now enable
	Extended match ID's by default. They can be disabled with
	--disable-extmatchid

2011-05-17  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gnubg.c, backgammon.h, gtkfile.c, gtkrelational.c: The word 
	"Relational" has been removed from the GUI when referring to the 
	database. This makes more sense to the casual users. Fixed the 
	situation where a Batch sometimes had to be preceded by a clear 
	match/session. Fixed bug reported by Leo that prevented matches 
	being analysed with incomplete analysis settings. Fixed bug
	reported by Leo Bueno that prevented matches that may not have been
	played to completion from being analysed. Added Warning if you 
	use incomplete analysis settings and have requested to save the 
	matches to the database

2011-05-13  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* eval.c, lib/inputs.c (new file), lib/Makefile.am: Computation of
	baseInputs() with SSE. The code was already there in eval.c, but
	commented out.

2011-05-08  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* lib/gnubg-types.h, lib/cache.h, lib/cache.c, backgammon.h,
	positionid.h, positionid.c, analysis.c, eval.c, export.c, eval.h,
	gnubg.c, gnubgmodule.c, gtkboard.c, gtkpanels.c, import.c, play.c,
	rollout.c, set.c, sgf.c, makebearoff.c, makehyper.c:
	Use a defined type for the position key.
	Small speed up with faster EqualKeys and CopyKey macros.

2011-04-10  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* board3d/drawboard3d.c board3d/fun3d.h board3d/shadow.c:
	Converted int to GLint where appropriate to avoid compiler
	warnings about incompatible types in certain build 
	environments.

2011-04-09  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* gtkexport.c, gtkgame.c, gtktempmap.c: Alter some pop-up panels
	that were too tall too be usable on smaller screens (the OK button
	was below the bottom of the display). Affected are
	Settings|Export, Settings|Rollouts and Analyze|Temperature Map.

2011-04-08  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gtkprefs.c: Fixed bug that disallowed import/export board
	designs from using file names with paths that had spaces on
	Windows (WIN32) platform.

2011-04-08  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gtkgame.c, play.c: Fixed bug that didn't update the cube
	properly when navigating from a non crawford game to crawford
	game. Reported by Ongun Alsac.

2011-04-06  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* configure.in, board3d/font3d.c, board3d/inc3d.h: Added
	better 3dboard autoconf support for Apple build environments.
	Use Apple OpenGL, and add appropriate check for GTK
	X windows headers. GTK does not necessarily rely on X as a
	backend.

2011-04-06  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gnubg.c: Fixed WIN32 specific bug that caused command 
	filenames with spaces to not be processed. Reported by Nardy.     

2011-03-23  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gtkboard.c, play.c, gtkgame.c: Fixed bug that caused
	crawford flag to be unset in the GUI if you changed to
	a crawford game in the game list. Reported by Phillipe
	Michel. Fixed bug that caused a new money session to
	not correctly use the global Jacoby setting in some
	cases.

2011-03-23  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	* gtkboard.c: Update global match state with changes in
	score made through edit mode. Fixes hint/edit bug reported

	* gtkboard.c: Did cleanup of new Jacoby code.
	Modified the edit GUI to enforce proper Crawford
	settings when editing. If scores and match length
	make Crawford impossible, disable Crawford toggle
	and turn off Crawford until settings make it possible

2011-03-22  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	*  gnubg.c, gtkgame.c, gtkboard.c, matchid.c, play.c
	set.c, gtkboard.h: Improve support for Jacoby. 
	- When using extended Match ID's - Jacoby comes from 
	  the ID, 
	- When using regular ID's Jacoby is decided by the
	  global "Jacoby" setting in options. 
	- Fixed bug with Jacoby being read from an extended ID. 
	- Added Jacoby flag to the table. When MatchLen is
	  0 (money session) Crawford flag replaced by Jacoby
	  and vice versa.
	- Fixed some editing issues with Crawford

2011-03-22  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	*  gtkgame.c, simpleboard.c, gnubgmodule.c, matchid.c
	matchid.h, configure.in, play.c : Began adding support
	for an extended matchID that includes Jacoby. While in
	testing phase ./configure supports  --enable-extmatchid
	and a USE_EXTENDEDMATCHID define in config.h. By default
	builds do not have this feature turned on.

2011-03-20  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* gnubg.c: Fixed missing handling of MOVE_SETBOARD records in
	swapGame(). Needed for single positions (bug #32272) and games
	with illegal moves.

2011-03-19  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* set.c: Don't change the global Jacoby setting when pasting a XGID.

2011-03-17  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	statistics dialog that caused both players data to
	be the same. Added player names to the match statistic
	tables (treeviews). Reported by Boomslang

2011-03-17  Philippe Michel  <philippe.michel7@sfr.fr>

	* positionid.h, eval.c: Speed improvements.

2011-03-14  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	*  gnubg.c, sound.c, configure.in : Added support for Apple
	CoreAudio sound on platforms that are supported. CoreAudio
	takes precedence over QuickTime. This should allow for native
	64bit builds without the need for an external sound player.

2011-03-10  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	*  gnubg.c: Fixed bug with random numbers being read from
	www.random.org preventing GNUBG from exiting. We now skip HTTP 
	headers and make sure we don't read more numbers than the
	dice array can hold. Reported by Leo Bueno.

2011-03-07  Michael Petch  <mpetch@gnubg.org>

	*  board3d/drawboard3d.c: Fixed array indexing issue in drawDice that
	would cause hangs/crashes on OS/X when "set gui dicearea on" with
	3D boards were on. Crash would occur during program startup. May be
	related to fix commited on 2009-03-26 by Christian. 
	Reported by Pierre Viau.

	  is used globally but needs to be modified to match the set of
	  moves being rolled out. Ensuring it's put back for all
	  sequences which might terminate a rollout is non-trivial

Mon Jul  7 11:38 CET 2003  Olivier Baur  <olivier.baur@noos.fr>

        Fix bug: when playing against gnubg, you would sometimes
        get several games in a row with identical dice sequences
        (reported by Peter O Lura <polura@online.no>); the issue
        actually arises when a new game is started after having
        performed a rollout, which "resets" the RNG to the
        "rollout seed".

	* rollout.c (RolloutGeneral): add call to InitRNG at end of
            rollout to make sure that next game played against gnubg
            won't get dice rolls based on the seed of a rollout that
            has just been performed.

Sun Jul  6 18:01:08 2003  Joern Thyssen  <jth@gnubg.org>

        * eval.c (EvalKey): do not include cubeful flags, match scores, etc.
        in calculation of hash key for 0-ply evaluations unless called 
        from EvaluatePositionCubeful.

Sun Jul  6 13:48:46 2003  Joern Thyssen  <jth@gnubg.org>

Sat Jul  5 20:53:42 2003  Joseph Heled  <pepster@users.sourceforge.net>

        * gnubg.c: replace 'const' with ICONV_CONST to get rid of compiler
        warning.

Thu Jul 3 15:02 GMT 2003 Jim Segrave jes@jes-2.demon.nl

        * openurl.c gtktheory.c gtkboard.c osr.c eval.c gnubg.c

          cast added in gnubg.c, config.h included in event.c (and
          fix of call to outputerr()), add explicit returns in eval.c
          for reaching end of non-void function

Thu Jun 31 18:23:52 2003  Joern Thyssen  <jth@gnubg.org>
