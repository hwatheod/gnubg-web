        of twenty-four narrow triangles called points. The triangles alternate
        in color and are grouped into four quadrants of six triangles each. The
        quadrants are referred to as a player's home board and outer board, and
        the opponent's home board and outer board. The home and the outer boards
        are separated from each other by a ridge down the center of the board
        called the bar.</p><div class="figure"><a id="gnubg-fig_init"></a><p class="title"><strong>Figure 1. A board with the checkers in their initial position.</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/rulfig1.png" alt="A board with the checkers in their initial position." /></div></div></div><br class="figure-break" /><p>An alternate arrangement is the reverse of the one shown here, with
        the home board on the left and the outer board on the right.</p><p>The points are numbered for either player starting in that player's
        home board. The outermost point is the twenty-four point, which is also
        the opponent's one point. Each player has fifteen checkers of his own
        color. The initial arrangement of checkers is: two on each player's
        twenty-four point, five on each player's thirteen point, three on each
        player's eight point, and five on each player's six point.</p><p>Both players have their own pair of dice and a dice cup used for
        shaking. A doubling cube, with the numerals 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 on
	its faces, is used to keep track of the current stake of the game.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Object of the Game"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="gnubg-rules_object"></a>Object of the Game</h3></div></div></div><p>The object of the game is for a player to move all of his checkers
        into his own home board and then bear them off. The first player to bear
        off all of his checkers wins the game.</p><div class="figure"><a id="gnubg-fig_direction"></a><p class="title"><strong>Figure 2. Direction of movement of White's checkers. Red's checkers move in
          the opposite direction.</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/rulfig2.png" alt="Direction of movement of White's checkers.

This determines
        both the player to go first and the numbers to be played. If equal
        numbers come up, then both players roll again until they roll different
        numbers. The player throwing the higher number now moves his checkers
        according to the numbers showing on both dice. After the first roll, the
        players throw two dice and alternate turns.</p><p>The roll of the dice indicates how many points, or pips, the player
        is to move his checkers. The checkers are always moved forward, to a
        lower-numbered point. The following rules apply:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>A checker may be moved only to an open point, one that is not
            occupied by two or more opposing checkers. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The numbers on the two dice constitute separate moves. For
            example, if a player rolls 5 and 3, he may move one checker five
            spaces to an open point and another checker three spaces to an open
            point, or he may move the one checker a total of eight spaces to an
            open point, but only if the intermediate point (either three or five
            spaces from the starting point) is also open.</p><div class="figure"><a id="gnubg-fig_opening"></a><p class="title"><strong>Figure 3. White opens the game with 53.</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/rulfig3.png" alt="White opens the game with 53." /></div></div></div><br class="figure-break" /></li><li class="listitem"><p>A player who rolls doubles plays the numbers shown on the dice
            twice. A roll of 6 and 6 means that the player has four sixes to
            use, and he may move any combination of checkers he feels
            appropriate to complete this requirement. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A player must use both numbers of a roll if this is legally
            possible (or all four numbers of a double). When only one number can
            be played, the player must play that number. Or if either number can
            be played but not both, the player must play the larger one. When
            neither number can be used, the player loses his turn. In the case
            of doubles, when all four numbers cannot be played, the player must
            play as many numbers as he can. </p></li></ol></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Hitting and Entering"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="gnubg-rules_hitting"></a>Hitting and Entering</h3></div></div></div><p>A point occupied by a single checker of either color is called a
        blot. If an opposing checker lands on a blot, the blot is hit and placed
        on the bar.</p><p>Any time a player has one or more checkers on the bar, his first
        obligation is to enter those checker(s) into the opposing home board. A
        checker is entered by moving it to an open point corresponding to one of
        the numbers on the rolled dice.</p><p>For example, if a player rolls 4 and 6, he may enter a checker onto
        either the opponent's four point or six point, so long as the
        prospective point is not occupied by two or more of the opponent's
        checkers.</p><div class="figure"><a id="gnubg-fig_bar"></a><p class="title"><strong>Figure 4. White rolls 64 with a checker on the bar.</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/rulfig4.png" alt="White rolls 64 with a checker on the bar." /></div></div></div><br class="figure-break" /><p> If White rolls [64] with a checker on the bar, he must enter the
        checker onto Red's four point since Red's six point is not open. If
        neither of the points is open, the player loses his turn. If a player is
        able to enter some but not all of his checkers, he must enter as many as
        he can and then forfeit the remainder of his turn.</p><p>After the last of a player's checkers has been entered, any unused
        numbers on the dice must be played, by moving either the checker that
        was entered or a different checker.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Bearing Off"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="gnubg-rules_bearingoff"></a>Bearing Off</h3></div></div></div><p>Once a player has moved all of his fifteen checkers into his home
        board, he may commence bearing off. A player bears off a checker by
        rolling a number that corresponds to the point on which the checker
        resides, and then removing that checker from the board. Thus, rolling a
        6 permits the player to remove a checker from the six point.</p><p>If there is no checker on the point indicated by the roll, the
        player must make a legal move using a checker on a higher-numbered
        point. If there are no checkers on higher-numbered points, the player is
        permitted (and required) to remove a checker from the highest point on
        which one of his checkers resides. A player is under no obligation to
        bear off if he can make an otherwise legal move.</p><div class="figure"><a id="gnubg-fig_bearoff"></a><p class="title"><strong>Figure 5. White rolls 64 and bears off two checkers.</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/rulfig5.png" alt="White rolls 64 and bears off two checkers." /></div></div></div><br class="figure-break" /><p>A player must have all of his active checkers in his home board in
        order to bear off. If a checker is hit during the bear-off process, the
        player must bring that checker back to his home board before continuing
        to bear off. The first player to bear off all fifteen checkers wins the
        game.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Doubling"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="gnubg-rules_doubling"></a>Doubling</h3></div></div></div><p>Backgammon is played for an agreed stake per point. Each game starts
        at one point. During the course of the game, a player who feels he has a
        sufficient advantage may propose doubling the stakes. He may do this
        only at the start of his own turn and before he has rolled the dice.</p><p>A player who is offered a double may refuse, in which case he
        concedes the game and pays one point. Otherwise, he must accept the
        double and play on for the new higher stakes. A player who accepts a
        double becomes the owner of the cube and only he may make the next
        double.</p><p>Subsequent doubles in the same game are called redoubles. If a
        player refuses a redouble, he must pay the number of points that were at
        stake prior to the redouble. Otherwise, he becomes the new owner of the
        cube and the game continues at twice the previous stakes. There is no
        limit to the number of redoubles in a game.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Gammons and Backgammons"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="gnubg-rules_gammons"></a>Gammons and Backgammons</h3></div></div></div><p>At the end of the game, if the losing player has borne off at least
        one checker, he loses only the value showing on the doubling cube (one
        point, if there have been no doubles). However, if the loser has
          <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> borne off any of his checkers, he is gammoned
        and loses <span class="emphasis"><em>twice</em></span> the value of the doubling cube. Or,
        worse, if the loser has not borne off any of his checkers and still has
        a checker on the bar or in the winner's home board, he is backgammoned
        and loses <span class="emphasis"><em>three times</em></span> the value of the double
      cube.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Optional Rules"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="gnubg-rules_optional"></a>Optional Rules</h3></div></div></div><p>The following optional rules are in widespread use.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Automatic doubles. If identical numbers are thrown on the first
            roll, the stakes are doubled. The doubling cube is turned to 2 and
            remains in the middle. Players usually agree to limit the number of
            automatic doubles to one per game.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Beavers. When a player is doubled, he may immediately redouble
            (beaver) while retaining possession of the cube. The original
            doubler has the option of accepting or refusing as with a normal
            double. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The Jacoby Rule. Gammons and backgammons count only as a single
            game if neither player has offered a double during the course of the
            game. This rule speeds up play by eliminating situations where a
            player avoids doubling so he can play on for a gammon. </p></li></ol></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Rules for Match Play"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="gnubg-rules_match"></a>Rules for Match Play</h3></div></div></div><p>When backgammon tournaments are held to determine an overall winner,
        the usual style of competition is match play. Competitors are paired
        off, and each pair plays a series of games to decide which player
        progresses to the next round of the tournament. This series of games is
        called a match.</p><p>Matches are played to a specified number of points. The first player
        to accumulate the required points wins the match. Points are awarded in
        the usual manner: one for a single game, two for a gammon, and three for
        a backgammon. The doubling cube is used, so the winner receives the value
        of the game multiplied by the final value of the doubling cube.</p><p>Matches are normally played using the Crawford rule. The Crawford
        rule states that if one player reaches a score one point short of the
        match, neither player may offer a double in the immediately following
        game. This one game with no doubling is called the Crawford game. If the
        Crawford game is won by the trailing player then the doubling cube becomes
        available in all subsequent games (and it's most often in the best
        interests of the trailing player to double immediately in these games).</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col /><col /><col /><col /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>Match to 5</td><td>White</td><td>Black</td><td>Doubling</td></tr><tr><td>White wins 2</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>Black wins 1 </td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>White wins 2 </td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>Black wins 1 </td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>Crawford Game</td></tr><tr><td>Black wins 2 </td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>White wins 2 </td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>Allowed</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>In this example, White and Black are playing a 5-point match. After
        three games White has 4 points, which is just one point short of what he
        needs. That triggers the Crawford rule which says there can be no
        doubling in next game, Game 4.</p><p>There is no bonus for winning more than the required number of
        points in match play. The sole goal is to win the match, and the size of
        the victory doesn't matter.</p><p>Automatic doubles, beavers, and the Jacoby rule are not used in
        match play.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Starting GNU Backgammon"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="gnubg-starting"></a>Starting GNU Backgammon</h2></div><div><div class="abstract" title="Abstract"><p class="title"><strong>Abstract</strong></p><p>Starting GNU Backgammon.

        place checkers. The number of checkers placed on the point is depending
        on where you click, for example if you want to place 3 checkers on a
        point, clicking on the location where the third checker would go places
        3 checkers. This method should be familiar to Snowie users.</p><p>Clicking with the left button places checkers for player1, clicking
        with the right button places checkers for player2. If you want to place
        more than 5 checkers, click multiple times on the tip of the point. To
        clear a point, click on the border of the board below or above the point
        - depending on if the point is in the lower or top half of the board.
        The bar works just like normal points - the more you click to the middle

You
        can drag and drop checkers around the board while you're holding down
        the Ctrl key on your keyboard. Press the Ctrl key and hold it down. Then
        left-click the checker you want to drag to another point and drag it
        with the mouse, (while holding down the Ctrl key and the left mouse
        button), to the destination point. You can drag checkers to open points
        or to points where you have checkers of the same color. You can also
        'hit' opponent blots with the drag and drop edit method.</p><p>This method of editing comes handy when there is just a small
        adjustment to be done in the position.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Setting the player on turn"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="gnubg-edit_turn"></a>Setting the player on turn</h3></div></div></div><p>The player on turn can be set by clicking the small checker icons

          appear under the game record. The analysis window is basically the
          same as the Hint window described in the "[[Playing a game or match]]"
          chapter.</p><div class="figure"><a id="gnubg-fig_analyzepane"></a><p class="title"><strong>Figure 19. The Analyze pane</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/analysepane.png" alt="[[analasyepane.png]]" /></div></div></div><br class="figure-break" /><p>In the figure you can see the analysis panel. At the top of the
          analysis panel you will see three pull-down menus. The leftmost
          pull-down menu is a comment on the cube decision. In the figure it is
          a position where the player didn't double and the <span class="application">GNU
            Backgammon</span>'s analysis of this is empty. There was
          nothing wrong with not doubling in this position. The user can also
          override <span class="application">GNU Backgammon</span>'s evaluation and
          mark the cube decision as 'Doubtful', 'Bad' or 'Very bad'. Note that
          the cube decision pull-down menu will only be visible when the player
          has the cube available.</p><p>The next pull-down menu shows a simple analysis of the roll. The
          roll in this position was 32. <span class="application">GNU
          Backgammon</span>'s evaluation of this dice roll is also empty.
          It shows that this particular roll was -.162 equity worse than the
          average roll. This means that the roll is a bit unlucky, but does not
          qualify for being marked as an unlucky roll. The rolls are marked in
          these categories: 'Very lucky', 'Lucky', 'Unlucky' and 'Very unlucky'.</p><p>The rightmost pull-down menu, shows the move which was done. In
          this situation the move that was done was 3/off 2/off. This move did
          not qualify for any mark. Moves that <span class="application">GNU
          Backgammon</span> don't like will be marked as 'Doubtful',
          'Bad' or 'Very bad'. The user can also override <span class="application">GNU
            Backgammon</span>'s evaluation and mark the move manually
          with the pull-down menu.</p><p>The rest of the analysis window is a notebook of two pages. The
          first page is the list of possible moves. The list is sorted in the
          ranked order with the best considered move at the top. The moves are
          sorted by equity or EMG. In the list in the figure there is only two
          possible moves. The move that was actually done in the match, is
          marked with red color. The only difference of this list of moves and
          the list of moves in the hint window, is that this list does not show
          the probabilities for each outcome of the game. If you want to see the
          probabilities of the different outcomes, you can click on the button
          labeled Details. This will then show you a list with these numbers.</p><p>The other page of the notebook is the cube decision analysis. This
          analysis show exactly the same as in the Hint window described in the
          chapter called "[[Playing a game or match]]". Note that the cube
          decision page will only be available if there is a cube decision. It
          will not be visible if the cube is not available to the player.</p><p>There is also a set of tool buttons in the analysis panel. These
          buttons does exactly the same as the tool buttons in the Hint window,
          which is described in the the chapter called "[[Playing a game or

        that could result from playing this position, how many do we win (and
        how many of our wins and losses are gammons, and how many are
        backgammons)? The model is exactly the same as if we had an urn with a
        googol balls in it (it's a big urn), and many of the balls have win
        written on them, and some say gammon loss, and if we look hard enough
        there are a few that read backgammon win, and so on. (Balls and urns
        are to probability theorists what teapots and checkerboards are to
        computer graphics researchers, or <span class="emphasis"><em>squeamish
        ossifrage</em></span> is to cryptographers; they seem to come with the
        territory.) Instead of having the patience to count the googol balls,
        we just give the urn a really good shake and then pull 100 balls out
        without looking, and say for instance "Well, I got 53 wins, 31 losses, 9
        gammon wins, 6 gammon losses, and a backgammon win. It looks like my
        equity's roughly +0.26." and go home. If we were a bit more thorough, we
        could go a bit further and figure out that by cheating and measuring the
        sample proportions instead of the population proportions, we introduced
        a standard error of 0.06 into our result. (Of course, the trick is to
        select a sample size that's big enough that you reduce the standard
        error to a tolerable level, but small enough that the answer arrives
        before you get bored.)</p><p>It will come as no surprise that a rollout with a limited number of
        trials follows exactly the same procedure. It's sufficient to say that
        the proportion of wins/gammons etc. that come up when <span class="application">GNU
          Backgammon</span> plays against itself (say) 1296 times, aren't
        likely to vary all that much from the proportion we would get if we
        measured the proportion of results in every game we could possibly get
        of <span class="application">GNU Backgammon</span> playing against itself. (Of
        course, there may still be some doubt whether the results of
          <span class="application">GNU Backgammon</span> vs. <span class="application">GNU

        implements the procedure described above, with the following
        improvements:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Truncation: instead of rolling out all the way to the end of the
            game, it can stop and pretend its evaluation after a few plies is
            perfect. This may obviously introduce some amount of systematic
            error, but in practice this may not matter because: </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>it makes rollouts much faster, which means you can do more of
            them (and thus trade sampling error for systematic error); </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>different positions will be reached in different trials, so the
            correlation between errors in each trial weakens and the errors
            cancel out to some extent; </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>if you are rolling out the positions after making different
            plays, then any remaining systematic error between the two rollouts
            is likely to be somewhat correlated and so the error in the
            comparison between the plays is hopefully small. This implies that
            truncated rollouts are better for estimating
            <span class="emphasis"><em>relative</em></span> equity (<span class="emphasis"><em>which is the better
              move here, 13/10*/9 or 13/10* 6/5*?</em></span>) than
              <span class="emphasis"><em>absolute</em></span> equity (<span class="emphasis"><em>at this match
              score I need 29% wins to accept a dead cube; can I take in this
              position?</em></span>). </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Race database truncation: when the game enters its 2-sided
            bearoff database, <span class="application">GNU Backgammon</span> can
            estimate the probability of winning from that position with no error
            at all (it can play and evaluate endgame positions perfectly), which
            saves time and avoids introducing the errors that can result from
            large equity variances at the end of the game. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Variance reduction: when using lookahead evaluations, it can
            reduce errors by making use of the equity difference from one ply to
            the next. (This can be interpreted as either canceling out the
            estimated <span class="emphasis"><em>luck</em></span> (i.e. the difference in equity
            evaluations before and after rolling) or using subsequent
            evaluations to estimate the error in prior ones; the two views are
            equivalent). <span class="application">GNU Backgammon</span> automatically
            performs variance reduction when looking ahead at least one ply.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Stratified sampling: uses quasi-random number generation instead
            of pseudo-random number generation (this is a standard technique in
            Monte Carlo simulations where having a near-perfect uniform
            distribution in your sample is more important than
            unpredictability). <span class="application">GNU Backgammon</span> only
            stratifies the first 2 plies of a rollout, though it would be easy
            enough to extend it to the remainder. </p></li></ol></div><div class="sect3" title="Quasi-Random Dice"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="gnubg-rollouts_gnubg_quasi"></a>Quasi-Random Dice</h4></div></div></div><p>Quasi-Random Dice are used to reduce the element of luck in
        rollouts. Instead of selecting purely random dice, <span class="application">GNU
          Backgammon</span> will ensure a uniform distribution of the
        first roll of the rollout. If 36 trials are requested, one game will
        start with 11, two games with 21, two games with 31, etc. In general, if
        n * 36 games is requested, n games will start with 11, 2*n games with 21
        etc. This is called <span class="emphasis"><em>rotation</em></span> of the first roll.
        Similarly, if n*1296 trials is requested, the second roll will be
        rotated, such that n games will start with 11-11, n games with 11-21, n
        games with 21-21, etc. The third roll be also be rotated if the number
        of trials is proportional to 46656.</p><p>Suppose a user stops a 1296 trial rollout after 36 games. The 36
        games would have had the following rolls for the first two rolls of each
        game: 11-11, 21-11, 12-11, 31-11, 13-11, ..., 66-11 Obviously such a
        rollout will give skewed results since the second roll was 11 for all
        games! To avoid this problem <span class="application">GNU Backgammon</span>
        will randomize the sequence of rolls such that it is guaranteed that for
        any sample of 36 games you have exactly one game with first roll 11,
        exactly one game with second roll 11, etc. This is called
          <span class="emphasis"><em>stratification</em></span>.</p><p><span class="application">GNU Backgammon</span> will actually also rotate
        and stratify rollouts where the number of trials are not multiples of
        36, 1296, etc. The distribution of rolls is obviously not uniform any
        longer in this case, but it will still provide some reduction of the
        luck, i.e., no 37 trial rollout will have 3 games with a initial 66.</p><p>Before the first game of a rollout, <span class="application">GNU
        Backgammon</span> creates a pseudo random array which it will use
        for all the games in the rollout. In effect it has already decided the
        roll sequence it will use for up to 128 rolls in every game of the
        rollout. In other words, for a normal rollout where games don't go over
        64 moves, every single game of every possible rollout length has already
        had its dice sequence determined. During the rollout of game n, sequence
        n will be used, for game n+1 sequence n+1, etc. If it's a
          <span class="emphasis"><em>rollout as initial position</em></span>, then whenever the
        current sequence starts with a double, the sequence is skipped and the
        dice routine moves on to the next sequence. Say an <span class="emphasis"><em>rollout as
          initial position</em></span> is about to start using sequence 275, but
        that sequence begins with a double. The dice routine moves to sequence
        276. On the following game, it will use sequence 277 (it remembers how
        many it has already skipped).</p><p>So, if you select <span class="emphasis"><em>rollout as initial position</em></span>
        and 36 games, then you will get a prefect set of rolls for games 1..30
        and the first 6 rolls of the next perfect set (the same rolls you would
        have gotten for games 31..36 if you'd asked for 1080 games or 10800
        games or 92 games or whatever.</p><p>The dice sequence doesn't know how many trials it will be asked for,
        it simply generates sequences such that for a normal rollout
          (<span class="emphasis"><em>rollout as initial position</em></span>) every 36 (30) games
        you get all possible 1st rolls, every 1296 (1080) games get every
        possible first 2 rolls, every 46656 (38880) games you get full sets of 3
        rolls, etc.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Customizing GNU Backgammon"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="gnubg-custom"></a>Customizing <span class="application">GNU Backgammon</span></h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Evaluation settings"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="gnubg-custom_eval"></a>Evaluation settings</h3></div></div></div><div class="sect3" title="Introduction to evaluation settings"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="gnubg-custom_eval_intro"></a>Introduction to evaluation settings</h4></div></div></div><p><span class="application">GNU Backgammon</span> evaluation functionality
          is driven by 3 separate neural networks. The neural nets evaluates
          each position statically, and returns the outcome probabilities of the
          game at the given position. However, there are several different
          methods and techniques that an evaluation can use, and these can be
          adjusted. It's possible to set different levels of lookahead, it's
          possible to add noise to the evaluation, and each evaluation can be

          a player. Any position can be evaluated at 0-ply. That means that GNU
          Backgammon does not look ahead in the game to evaluate the position.
          When GNU Backgammon is evaluating a checker play decision, it looks at
          all resulting positions after all the legal moves with the given dice
          roll, and evaluates these position at the given ply. It's possible to
          set the search depth by specifying the plies lookahead in any
          evaluation settings dialog.</p><p>Snowie users: <span class="application">GNU Backgammon</span> differs
          from some other software, notably Snowie in that <span class="application">GNU
            Backgammon</span> zero ply is the same as Snowie 1 ply. In
          the same way what is called 2-ply in <span class="application">GNU
          Backgammon</span> will therefore be similar to a Snowie 3-ply.</p><p>For <span class="application">GNU Backgammon</span>, a 0-ply evaluation
          of a move would be done by:</p><p>Build a list of all legal moves. For each move, take the resulting
          board position and use the neural net to estimate the expected
          percentage of wins/gammons/backgammons/losses/gammon losses/backgammon
          losses. Rank the moves based on this evaluation.</p><p>For one ply, after doing the above step, <span class="application">GNU
            Backgammon</span> chooses the best n moves (where n is set by
          the move filters). For each one, it takes the resulting position for
          that move and goes through all 21 possible dice rolls for the
          opponent. From these results, it works out the average expectation for
          the initial move and ranks them. This is the same as Snowie 2 ply. You
          can think of it as asking "what's my best move if I also consider
          every possible dice roll and move my opponent might make?"</p><p>For 2 ply (Snowie 3 ply), a similar process is done, but this
          time, not only are the opponents possible moves considered, but, for
          each of these, the player on roll's next move will be considered as
          well.</p><p>For a single move, on average there are about 20 legal moves to
          consider.</p><p>When doing a one ply analysis/evaluation, for the top n moves
          (from the move filter, <span class="application">GNU Backgammon</span> needs
          to consider 21 rolls by the opponent, 20 and possible legal moves per
          roll) = 420 positions to evaluate.</p><p>Every additional ply will multiply the previous number of
          evaluations by about 400 odd, which explains the huge difference in
          playing speed/analysis speed between 0 ply and 2 ply settings. I don't
          think many people would enjoy playing against <span class="application">GNU
            Backgammon</span> at 3 ply settings, where moves could take
          minutes to be selected. It's also not clear that using much deeper
          lookahead actually gains a lot in terms of playing strength - if you
          really need better answers than 2 ply, rollouts are probably a lot
          better.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Defining evaluation settings"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="gnubg-custom_eval_define"></a>Defining evaluation settings</h4></div></div></div><p>First of all: There are several places in <span class="application">GNU
            Backgammon</span> where you can adjust either it's skill at
          playing or the quality of it's hints and analysis:</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Playing skill:"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="gnubg-custom_eval_skill"></a>Playing skill:</h4></div></div></div><p><span class="guimenu">Settings</span> &#8594; <span class="guimenuitem">Players</span> &#8594; <span class="guimenuitem">Player 0</span> - choose Supremo or World Class. GNU Backgammon will
          take longer choosing its moves, but they will be very strong. At this
          setting, it is much stronger than Jellyfish level 7.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Hints:"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="gnubg-custom_eval_hint"></a>Hints:</h4></div></div></div><p><span class="guimenu">Settings</span> &#8594; <span class="guimenuitem">Evaluation</span> - choose Supremo or World Class if you want hints to be
          very accurate, but, like the playing skill setting, you may find that
          it can take as long as 15 seconds to get an answer on a 1GHz PC.
          Expert will be very fast, but for some positions where you need to
          consider what your opponent may do on his roll and how you will follow
          it up, the results will be less accurate. A wild guess would be
          somewhere around 2 or 3 percent of the time, World Class or stronger
          settings would give a different best move and maybe less than 1/2
          percent of the time, the Expert result would be seriously
        wrong.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Analysis:"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="gnubg-custom_eval_analysis"></a>Analysis:</h4></div></div></div><p><span class="guimenu">Settings</span> &#8594; <span class="guimenuitem">Analysis</span> - these settings are used by the Analyze Move/Game/Match
          or Session command. Note that this is totally different to what is
          used in the Hint command, which uses the above settings. You probably
          want at least World Class here. My experience on a 700MHz PC is that a
          7 point match takes about 15 to 20 minutes to analyze on the Supremo
          settings. But the results tend to be very accurate.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Rollouts:"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="gnubg-custom_eval_rollout"></a>Rollouts:</h4></div></div></div><p><span class="guimenu">Settings</span> &#8594; <span class="guimenuitem">Rollouts</span> &#8594; <span class="guimenuitem">General Settings</span> tick the boxes for 'Cube decisions use same settings

          rollouts, most of the time Expert play will be more than strong enough
          if you do say 1296 trials with no truncation. The rollout function has
          an enormous number of options, most of which are only useful when
          trying to investigate special positions. The simple expert setting for
          both players is probably more accurate than any of the Analysis
          functions. The downside is that rolling out 1296 trials of an early
          move in a game can take a couple of hours. On World Class or Supremo
          rollout settings, it can take more than 24 hours of computing
        time.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Changing evaluation settings"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="gnubg-custom_eval_dialog"></a>Changing evaluation settings</h4></div></div></div><p>A typical evaluation settings dialog is shown in this figure.</p><div class="figure"><a id="gnubg-fig_evaldialog"></a><p class="title"><strong>Figure 20. The evaluation settings dialog</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/evalsetting.png" alt="[[evalsettings.png]]" /></div></div></div><br class="figure-break" /><p>The dialog is consisting of two columns, the left column is for
          setting the checker play decision evaluation settings, and the right
          column is for setting the cube decision evaluation settings.</p><p>For each column you can select some predefined settings, or you
          can define your own settings.</p><p>In the lookahead box, you can adjust the lookahead of each
          evaluation by specifying the plies to be evaluated. Each ply costs
          approximately a factor of 21 in computational time. Also note that
          2-ply is equivalent to Snowie's 3-ply setting.</p><p>In the box for Cubeful evaluations, you can specify if you want
          GNU Backgammon to evaluate the cube ownership in its evaluations.
          With this option turned on it generally improves the evaluation,
          specially when it's close to cube decisions, so we recommend that this
          option is turned on.</p><p>In the Noise box, you can add noise to the evaluation. This can be
          smart if you think the program plays to strong. You can use the Noise
          box option to introduce noise or errors in the evaluations. This is
          useful for introducing levels below 0-ply. The lower rated bots (e.g.,
          GGotter) on the GamesGrid backgammon server uses this technique. The
          introduced noise can be deterministic, i.e., always the same noise for

            2-ply as above. There is no pruning at 3-ply.</p><p>At 4-ply we do not accept any moves, but add up to two moves if
            there within 0.040 from the best move. Since the second best move is
            -0.138 worse than the best move, we do not accept any moves to be

            Backgammon analyzes at least two moves at the specified ply. To do
            this, specify accept 2 moves in the move filters you use for
            analysis. However, do note that <span class="application">GNU
            Backgammon</span> will force evaluation at the specified ply
            if the actual move made is doubtful. This ensures that all errors

            is examining at each ply. A ply is basically one move played by one
            side, thus if both sides played a move, it would be one whole move,
            but two plies, one for each side. To change the specific settings,
            press the Modify... button.</p><p>Although the predefined levels, such as World Class, Supremo,
            etc. are tested and good, you may want to know or control how GNU
            filters its moves to analyze and how many.</p><div class="figure"><a id="gnubg-fig_movefilter1"></a><p class="title"><strong>Figure 22. Move filter 1</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/movefilter1.png" alt="[[movefilter1.png]]" /></div></div></div><br class="figure-break" /><p>If you are playing Expert level (this is what GGRaccoon is set
            at) or another 0-ply setting, the Move Filter settings will not
            change a thing, as Expert level automatically examines all moves. At
            Supremo level, this changes though, as it takes a selection of the
            best moves from 0-ply and examines them at 2-ply. This means that
            for those selected moves it will calculate all the possibilities 2
            plies ahead and evaluate them, allowing it to find better moves.
            Since Supremo is a 2-ply setting, we are only interested in the
            2-ply settings of Large as in the figure above. 3-ply or 4-ply
            settings will have no effect here because Supremo doesn't examine at
            that depth.</p><p>In the figure above, we can see it first will Always accept 0
            moves. This first line means that it won't force any moves to be
            analyzed at 2-ply, it will only analyze moves according to the
            second line. If it had said it would always analyze 2 moves, this
            would mean that no matter how ridiculously bad the 2nd move was
            compared to the 1st, it would analyze both at 2-ply.</p><p>The second line says it will Add extra 16 moves within 0.320.
            This means that provided they aren't more than 0.320 equity worse
            than the top move, it will select a maximum of 16 moves to analyze
            at 2-ply. For example, in the figure below, the 2nd best move is no
            less than 0.453 equity worse than the top choice, so it didn't
            bother analyzing them at 2-ply as it is unlikely to change its mind
            on what the best move is.</p><div class="figure"><a id="gnubg-fig_movefilter2"></a><p class="title"><strong>Figure 23. Move filter 2</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/movefilter2.png" alt="[[movefilter2.png]]" /></div></div></div><br class="figure-break" /><p>Take a look at next figure.</p><div class="figure"><a id="gnubg-fig_movefilter3"></a><p class="title"><strong>Figure 24. Move filter 3</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/movefilter3.png" alt="[[movefilter3.png]]" /></div></div></div><br class="figure-break" /><p>Here, the exact same settings were maintained, but the 1-ply
            filter was activated. This just means that those 16 moves selected
            from the 0-ply are sent instead to be analyzed at 1-ply, and then up
            to 5 moves from 1-ply will be sent to be analyzed at 2-ply. So this
            would actually be faster than the previous setting (and weaker),
            since a maximum of only 5 moves would be analyzed at 2-ply depth.</p><p>Tip: Feel free to experiment with the settings, as you can
            always reset them by simply choosing one of the predefined levels.
            In order to see if they are better, or as good but faster, I'd
            suggest comparing the results with Supremo. One setting I have that
            works quite well, is to take the basic Supremo setting and in the
            Move filter reduce the 16 to 12. It cuts down on the thinking time
            by 20-25% more or less, and I haven't seen more than one case in
            over 10,000 moves where it missed the best move.</p></div></div><div class="sect3" title="Cubeful vs Cubeless"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="gnubg-eval_cubeful"></a>Cubeful vs Cubeless</h4></div></div></div><p>In the evaluation settings dialog box you can specify whether or
          not checker play should be evaluated cubeful. It's recommended that
          you use cubeful evaluation. To get an understanding of what cubeful
          checker play evaluations are, you can take a look at this position:</p><div class="figure"><a id="gnubg-fig_cubeful"></a><p class="title"><strong>Figure 25. Cubeful example</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/cubeful-ex1.png" alt="[[cubeful-ex1.png]]" /></div></div></div><br class="figure-break" /><p>In this position black has rolled 51 and he has a good position.
          If the position is evaluated cubeless the best move is 13/7. Black can
          hope white does not roll 34 or 35 form the bar and has now a good
          chance to close white out in the next few rolls. However if white
          rolls one of the four hitting numbers from the bar, white will quite
          soon have a really hot redouble. This redouble increases whites equity
          so much that black actually should play this move safe. He should play
          13/8 6/5. However if the evaluation was set to cubeless, an setting
          which assumes white will never redouble, black should play 13/8.</p><p>Here's another example:</p><div class="figure"><a id="gnubg-fig_cubeful2"></a><p class="title"><strong>Figure 26. Cubeful example 2</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/cubeful-ex2.png" alt="[[cubeful-ex2.png]]" /></div></div></div><br class="figure-break" /><p>This is from a 5 point match where black has 1 point and white has
          3 points. Black wins the opening roll and considers playing 13/11 6/5
          or 24/23 13/11.</p><p>If <span class="application">GNU Backgammon</span> uses a cubeless
          evaluation it will play 24/23 13/11. But if you're using a cubeful
          evaluation it will play 13/11 6/5. Slotting with 6/5 is at this score
          a better move even though it loses more gammons. The gammons black are
          losing won't matter anyway, since black will turn the cube in the next
          few rolls anyway. The slotting play also wins more gammons, and with
          the cube tuned to 2, black should play towards gammonish positions at
          this score.</p><p>You can read more about cubeful evaluations in the [[Appendix]].</p><p>It's recommended that you use cubeful checker evaluations.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Pruning neural networks"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="gnubg-custom_eval_pruning"></a>Pruning neural networks</h4></div></div></div><p>A feature in the evaluation is the use of a set of neural
          networks just to prune away move candidates within a deeper ply
          search. This increases the speed considerably and it doesn't lose much
          playing strength compared to evaluation without these pruning neural
          nets. Jim Segrave has just done an analysis of this and found that
          less than 1% of all moves come out different with the pruning nets
          activated. In most of these positions the move would not have made any
          difference to the game at all.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Noise"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="gnubg-custom_eval_noise"></a>Noise</h4></div></div></div><p>If you think <span class="application">GNU Backgammon</span> plays too
          strong for you, you can add some noise to its evaluation. The number
          you add into the field in the evaluations setting is the limit amount
          of noise that will be added to the evaluation.</p><p>If noise is added to the evaluations <span class="application">GNU
          Backgammon</span> will take a Box Müller transform of a point
          in the unit circle and add to each possible outcome probability. This
          means that the addition is random, but distributed so that it's more
          likely to have an noise addition close to zero than a noise addition
          close to the limit. The noise addition is limited to the number you
          put into the noise field in the dialog box.</p><p>If you check the box Deterministic noise, the noise added to each
          evaluation will be based on a sum of the bytes in the hash of the
          board position, which (by the central limit theorem) should have a
          normal distribution. In that way you will always have that same noise
          amount to a position, since the noise added to the evaluation is only
          depending on the position itself.</p><p>If you want <span class="application">GNU Backgammon</span> to evaluate
          and play as strong as possible, you should not add any noise.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Appearance"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="gnubg-custom_appearance"></a>Appearance</h3></div></div></div><p>You can change the appearance of <span class="application">GNU

          program makebearoff that is used to generate bearoff databases. Due to
          various limitations it is only possible to generate bearoff databases
          with a size less than 2GB, i.e., the 13pt one-sided database and the
          11 checker two-sided database are the largest databases that can be
          generated with makebearoff. </p><p>To generate one sided database issue </p><p>makebearoff -o 10 -f gnubg_os.bd</p><p>to generate the one sided 10 point database. The program
          makebearoff uses a cache to store previously generated positions. You
          may set the cache size with the -s size option, e.g., </p><p>makebearoff -o 10 -s 123456789 -f gnubg_os.bd</p><p>to use 123,456,789 bytes of memory for cache size. In general, if
          the cache size is less than the size of the database to be generated,
          then extra time is needed to generate the bearoff database because
          some positions may have to be calculated several times. </p><p>makebearoff can also reuse previously generated databases, so if
          you already had generated the 9 point database you can reuse it: </p><p>mv gnubg_os.bd gnubg_os9.bd</p><p>makebearoff -o 10 -O gnubg_os9.bd -f gnubg_os.bd</p><p>Note that makebearoff requires temporary disk space to generate
          both one sided and two sided databases. In general, twice the disk
          space of the database to be generated is needed. </p><p>To generate a two sided database issue </p><p>makebearoff -t 6x8 -f gnubg_ts.bd</p><p>This example will generate the 8 checkers on 6 points database.
          Again, it's possible to adjust the amount of memory with the -s
          option. It's recommended to set the cache size to the maximum amount
          of memory available (although there is no need to set it beyond the
          size of the bearoff database to be generated). </p><p>Other options for makebearoff are available, see makebearoff
          --help for the complete set. </p><p>The accompanying program makehyper is used to generate databases
          for Hypergammon. For example, to generate the 3-checker database issue
          the command </p><p>makehyper -c 3 -f hyper3.bd</p><p>Since the generation is <span class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> time consuming
          makehyper will generate a checkpoint file (in the example above:
          hyper1.bd.tmp) that can be used to restart the calculation if needed
          by using the -r option. You can also change the default convergence
          threshold of 0.00001 if you're happy with less accurate equities. To
          generate the 3 checker database you need approximately 400 MB of free
          memory. On a 2.4 GHz box with 512 MB of RAM the calculation ran for 58
          iterations of 3000 seconds each, i.e., a total of 48 hours! </p><p>See makehyper --help for the complete set of available options.

          different kinds of equities. The equity is defined as the expected
          value of the position. However, this value can be expressed in several
          different metrics and may be calculated with or without taking the
          effect of the cube into consideration. In the following section we
          will describe the equities used and calculated by GNU
        Backgammon.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Money equity"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="gnubg-tech_equities_money"></a>Money equity</h4></div></div></div><p>This is the value of the position in money game, e.g., if your
          equity is +0.4 an you are playing money game with a $1 stake, you will
          win $0.40 on average. The money equity can be calculated with or
          without taking the effect of the doubling cube into consideration, or
            <span class="emphasis"><em>cubeful</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>cubeless</em></span>. The
          cubeless equity can be calculated from the basic formula:
          2*p(w)-1+2(p(wg)-p(lg))+3(p(wbg)-p(lbg)). Evaluating the cubeful
          equity is much more difficult; it can either be estimated from the
          cubeless equity by using transformations as outlined by Rick Janowski
          or by constructing a neural net that directly outputs cubeful
	  equities. GNU Backgammon uses the former approach (<a class="xref" href="#gnubg-tech_equities_cubeful" title="Cubeful equities">the section called &#8220;Cubeful equities&#8221;</a>).</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Match Winning Chance"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="gnubg-tech_equities_match"></a>Match Winning Chance</h4></div></div></div><p>In match play we're generally not particular interested in the
          outcome of the individual games as much as the outcome of the entire
          match, so the interesting quantity for match play is <span class="emphasis"><em>match
            winning chance</em></span> (MWC). As for the money equity the MWC can
          be calculated with and without the effect of the doubling cube. The MWCs
          are generally calculated with the use of a match equity table, which
          contains the chance of winning the match before a game starts, e.g.,
          if the score is 0-0 in a 1pt match each player has 50% chance of
          winning the match before the game starts assuming they're of equal
          skill.</p><p>The cubeless MWC is calculated as: MWC(cubeless) = p(w) * MWC(w) +
          p(l) * MWC(l) + p(wg) * MWC(wg) + p(lg) * MWC(lg) + p(wbg) * MWC(wbg)
          * p(lbg) * MWC(lbg).</p><p>For example, if the w/g/bg distribution is 0 30 60 - 40 10 0 and
          the match score is 1-3 to 5 with the cube on 2 the cubeless MWC is:</p><p>MWC(cubeless)= 30% * 50% + 30% * 0% + 30% * 100% + 10% * 0% + 0% *
          100% + 0% * 0% = 45%,</p><p>so the cubeless MWC is 45%.</p><p>Evaluating the cubeful MWC is more difficult, and as for the
          cubeful money equity it's possible to estimate cubeful MWCs from
          transformation on the w/g/bg distribution or directly calculate it
          from neural nets. GNU Backgammon uses the former approach, but the
          formula are currently not published.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Normalized equity"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="gnubg-tech_eq_norm"></a>Normalized equity</h4></div></div></div><p>It's generally very difficult to compare MWCs. For example, it's
          hardly worth mentioning a 0.5% MWC error at DMP where as it's a huge
          error at 0-0 to 7. It is therefore of interesting to normalize the
          MWCs to some common scale. The most often used normalization is
          Normalized Money Game Equity (NEMG) where the MWC for any game is
          transformed into the same interval as money game, i.e., -3 to +3 (due
          to anomalies at certain match scores the NEMG can go below -3 and
          above +3). The transformation is linear:</p><p>NEMG = 2 * (MWC-MWC(l))/(MWC(w)-MWC(l)) - 1</p><p>In other words, extrapolation with the following two extrapolation
          points: (MWC(w),+1) and (MWC(l),-1).</p><p>For example, suppose the score is 3-1 to 5 with the cube on 2:
          MWC(l)=0% and MWC(w)=50%:</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col class="c1" /><col class="c2" /><col class="c3" /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>MWC</td><td>NEMG</td><td class="auto-generated"> </td></tr><tr><td>0%</td><td>-1</td><td class="auto-generated"> </td></tr><tr><td>25%</td><td>0</td><td class="auto-generated"> </td></tr><tr><td>50%</td><td>+1</td><td class="auto-generated"> </td></tr><tr><td>75%</td><td>+2</td><td class="auto-generated"> </td></tr><tr><td>100%</td><td>+3</td><td class="auto-generated"> </td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Note that a w/g/bg distribution of 0 100 100 - 0 0 0 gives a NEMG
          of +3 whereas the corresponding money equity is only +2. This is
          because the gammon price is high for that particular score. When both
          players are far from winning the match, e.g., 0-0 to 17 or 1-0 to 17,
          NEMG is very close to the usual money equity.</p><p>NEMG can be calculated from both cubeless and cubeful MWCs.</p><p>A word of caution: A cubeless NEMG calculated from a cubeless MWC
          could be named <span class="emphasis"><em>cubeless equity</em></span>, but in most
          backgammon literature this term seems to be reserved for the cubeless
          money equity.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Cubeful equities"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="gnubg-tech_equities_cubeful"></a>Cubeful equities</h4></div></div></div><p>This chapter is a brief description of how <span class="application">GNU
            Backgammon</span> calculates cubeful equities. The formula
          build directly on the work by Rick Janowski <a class="ulink" href="http://www.bkgm.com/articles/Janowski/cubeformulae.pdf" target="_top">Take-Points in Money Games</a> from 1993.</p><div class="sect4" title="Basic formula for cubeful equities"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="gnubg-tech_equities_cubeful_basic"></a>Basic formula for cubeful equities</h5></div></div></div><p>The basic formula for cubeful equities as derived by Janowski is</p><p>E(cubeful) = E(dead) * (1-x) + E(live) * x,</p><p>where E(dead) is the dead cube equity (cubeless equity) calculated
          from the standard formula. E(live) is the cubeful equity assuming a
          fully live cube. We'll return to that in the next section. x is the
          cube efficiency. x=0 gives E(cubeful)=E(dead) as one extreme and x=1
          gives E(cubeful)=E(live) as the other extreme. In reality x is

          equities, so how so <span class="application">GNU Backgammon</span>
          calculate cubeful 2-ply equities? The answer is: by simple recursion:</p><p>Equity=0</p><p>Loop over 21 dice rolls</p><p>Find best move for given roll</p><p>Equity = Equity + Evaluate n-1 ply equity for resulting position</p><p>End Loop</p><p>Equity = Equity/36</p><p>Note that evaluating the n-1 ply equity involves a cube decision,
          since the opponent may double, so <span class="application">GNU
          Backgammon</span> will actually calculate the two n-1 ply
          equities: (a) assuming no double, and (b) assuming double, take. These
          two equities are combined with the equity for a pass, and the optimum
          of these three is added to the resulting equity. For a cubeful 2-ply
          evaluation <span class="application">GNU Backgammon</span> will end up
          calculating the following cubeful 0-ply equities: centered 1-cube,
          opponent owns 2-cube, owned 4-cube, and opponent owns 8-cube.</p><p>Note that the 2-ply level does not use the cube efficiency, it's
          not used until at the 0-ply level, but it's possible to calculate an
          effective one by isolating x in the basic cube formula:</p><p>x(eff) = (E(2-ply cubeful) - E(2-ply dead))/(E(2-ply live)-E(2-ply

          unfortunately there haven't been much investigation carried out, so
            <span class="application">GNU Backgammon</span> basically uses the values
          0.6-0.7 originally suggested by Rick Janowski:</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col class="c1" /><col class="c2" /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>Position Class </td><td>x (Cube efficiency)</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>Two-sided (exact) bearoff</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>One-sided bearoff</td><td>0.6</td></tr><tr><td>Crashed</td><td>0.68</td></tr><tr><td>Contact</td><td>0.68</td></tr><tr><td>Race</td><td>linear interpolation between 0.6 and 0.7</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>For race <span class="application">GNU Backgammon</span> uses linear
          interpolation based on pip count for the player on roll. A pip count
          of 40 gives x=0.6 and 120 gives x=0.7. If the pip count is below 40 or
          above 120 values of x=0.6 and x=0.7 are used, respectively.</p><p>For the two sided bearoff positions the cubeful money equity is
          already available from the database, so for money game there is no
          need to calculate cubeful equities via Janowski's formula. However,
          the cubeful equities for money game cannot be used for match play.
          Instead of using a fixed value of x, say, 0.6, <span class="application">GNU
            Backgammon</span> will calculate an effective value based on
          the cubeful money equity. The cubeful MWC is calculated as usual, but
          with the calculated x.</p><p>There is obviously room for improvements. For example, holding
          games should intuitively have a lower cube efficiency, since it's very
          difficult to double effectively: either it's not good enough or you've
          lost the market by a mile after rolling a high double or hitting a
          single shot. Similarly, backgames will often have a low cube
          efficiency, whereas blitzes have may have a higher cube
        efficiency.</p></div><div class="sect4" title="Cube decisions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="gnubg-tech_equities_cubeful_decisions"></a>Cube decisions</h5></div></div></div><p><span class="application">GNU Backgammon</span>'s cube decisions are

            backgammon position. It demonstrates how to encode a position into
            10 binary bytes, which is useful for minimizing the space used when
            recording large numbers of positions in memory or on disk. There is
            also an ASCII representation in 14 characters, which is convenient
            for output to the screen, for copying and pasting to transfer
            positions between programs which support the format, and for
            communicating positions via Usenet news or e-mail. The 10 byte
            binary format is called the key, and the 14 character ASCII format
            is the ID.</p><p>The key is essentially a bit string (imagine you start with an
            empty sequence of bits, and continue adding either
            <span class="emphasis"><em>0</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>1</em></span> to the end). The
            way to build up a sequence that corresponds to a given position is:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>For every point around the board (starting at the ace point
                of the player on roll, continuing around to the 24 point and

                (if any). </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>append a 0. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>For every point around the board (starting at the ace point

            that there are always 50 0 bits even if there are no checkers at
            all. Each player has a maximum of 15 checkers in play (not yet borne
            off) which require a 1 bit wherever they are positioned. That's 30
            bits to take of all checkers, plus the 50 bits of overhead for a
            total of 80 bits (the last bit is always 0 and isn't strictly
            necessary, but it makes the code slightly easier). This bit string
            should be stored in little-endian order when packed into bytes (i.e.
            the first bits in the string are stored in the least significant
            bits of the first byte).</p><p>As an example, here's what the starting position looks like in

            consist of 14 characters followed by two = padding characters, but
            this padding is omitted in the ID format.)</p><p>To continue the above example, splitting the 10 8-bit bytes into

          bearoff database contains win probabilities for all bearoff positions
          with six or less checkers. It also contains cubeful equities (Money

          step deeper, i.e. it evaluates the position after making the best

          roll (that's 1 ply) and analyze the resulting positions. Playing at
          2-ply it will take each of those positions and make all the opponent
          moves for all possible rolls (the 2nd ply) and then analyze the

          the moves for all possible rolls (the 2nd ply) and analyze them. This

          required for a player to bear off all checkers from the current
          position. It can be regarded as a rough estimate of the
            <span class="emphasis"><em>raceness</em></span> of the position. A player with a
          lower pip count may in many situations want to try to race, whilst the
          opponent (with the higher pip count) may want to try blocking/holding.
          See also the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.bkgm.com/gloss/lookup.cgi?pip+count" target="_top">explanation on
            BackGammon Galore</a>.</p><p>(For the non-english speaking community it might be helpful to
          know that when you roll a six and a five, the total pips of that roll
          is eleven.)</p></div><div class="sect3" title="What does EPC mean?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="gnubg-faq_analysing_epc"></a>What does EPC mean?</h4></div></div></div><p>When bearing off checkers, you may notice a display showing the
          current <span class="emphasis"><em>EPC</em></span> value (next to the display of
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Pips</em></span>). The EPC display can be turned on or off
          under menu <span class="emphasis"><em>Settings -&gt; Options -&gt;
          Display</em></span>.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>EPC</em></span> stands for Effective Pip Count, and is an
          alternative measurement of the <span class="emphasis"><em>goodness</em></span> of the
          position. The usual pip count can be a misleading
          <span class="emphasis"><em>goodness</em></span> estimate when both players are bearing
          off. What is more important (for making cubing decisions) is
            <span class="emphasis"><em>the expected number of rolls</em></span> each player needs
          to bear off hes checkers.</p><p>The effective pip count is defined as this expected number of
          remaining rolls, multiplied with the average number of pips in a roll,
          which is 8.167. (The average number of pips in a roll would be 7 if
          rolling a double wouldn't yield a double pip count. A double-6
          yields 24 pips, not 12.)</p><p>Thus, EPC takes into account not only the current pip count, but
          also the expected pip wastage:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Effective Pip Count (EPC) = pip count + expected pip wastage
            </p></li></ol></div><p>An example:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Position: 5 checkers on the 1-point, 4 checkers on the
              2-point. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Pip count: 5x1 + 4x2 = 13 </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>EPC: 2.189 (expected number of remaining rolls) * 8.167 =
              17.878 </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Wasted: 17.878 - 13 = 4.878 </p></li></ol></div><p>It's clear (hopefully) that the expected pip wastage (and hence
          the <span class="emphasis"><em>EPC</em></span>) increases with more checkers on lower
          points (e.g. you get pip wastage when rolling a 6 to bear off a
          checker from the 2- or 1-point).</p><p>It is further <a class="ulink" href="http://www.bkgm.com/gloss/lookup.cgi?effective+pip+count" target="_top">explained on BackGammon Galore</a>, especially in a <a class="ulink" href="http://www.bkgm.com/rgb/rgb.cgi?view+1076" target="_top">post by Douglas
          Zare</a>.</p><p>How do one calculate the EPC then, or the expected number of
          remaining rolls? GnuBG uses the one-sided bearoff database, which
          contains the chance of bearing off the final checker in any given
          number of rolls. A player would probably use some quite complicated
          heuristics (please see the aforementioned post by Douglas Zare,

    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
    license document, but changing it is not allowed.
  </p><h3><a id="section0"></a>
    0. PREAMBLE
  </h3><p>
    The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
    functional and useful document &#8220;free&#8221; in the sense of freedom:
    to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with
    or without modifying it, either commercially or
    noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and
    publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered
    responsible for modifications made by others.
  </p><p>
    This License is a kind of &#8220;copyleft&#8221;, which means that
    derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same
    sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
    license designed for free software.
  </p><p>
    We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
    software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program
    should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software
    does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used
    for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is
    published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for
    works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
  </p><h3><a id="section1"></a>
    1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
  </h3><p>
    This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
    distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
    world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work
    under the conditions stated herein. The &#8220;Document&#8221;, below,
    refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee,
    and is addressed as &#8220;you&#8221;. You accept the license if you copy,
    modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under
    copyright law.
  </p><p>
    A &#8220;Modified Version&#8221; of the Document means any work containing
    the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
    modifications and/or translated into another language.
  </p><p>
    A &#8220;Secondary Section&#8221; is a named appendix or a front-matter
    section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of
    the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document&#8217;s overall
    subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
    directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a
    textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
    mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection
    with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
    philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
  </p><p>
    The &#8220;Invariant Sections&#8221; are certain Secondary Sections whose
    titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
    that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section
    does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to
    be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant
    Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then
    there are none.
  </p><p>
    The &#8220;Cover Texts&#8221; are certain short passages of text that are
    listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says
    that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may
    be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
  </p><p>
    A &#8220;Transparent&#8221; copy of the Document means a machine-readable
    copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the
    general public, that is suitable for revising the document
    straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
    pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
    drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
    automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
    formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
    markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage
    subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is
    not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is
    not &#8220;Transparent&#8221; is called &#8220;Opaque&#8221;.
  </p><p>
    Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
    without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML
    using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
    PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent
    image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary
    formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors,
    SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
    available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by
    some word processors for output purposes only.
  </p><p>
    The &#8220;Title Page&#8221; means, for a printed book, the title page
    itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
    material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in
    formats which do not have any title page as such, &#8220;Title Page&#8221;
    means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work&#8217;s
    title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
  </p><p>
    The &#8220;publisher&#8221; means any person or entity that distributes
    copies of the Document to the public.
  </p><p>
    A section &#8220;Entitled XYZ&#8221; means a named subunit of the Document
    whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
    following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands
    for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
    &#8220;Acknowledgements&#8221;, &#8220;Dedications&#8221;,
    &#8220;Endorsements&#8221;, or &#8220;History&#8221;.) To &#8220;Preserve
    the Title&#8221; of such a section when you modify the Document means that
    it remains a section &#8220;Entitled XYZ&#8221; according to this
    definition.
  </p><p>
    The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
    states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
    Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
    but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
    these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
    meaning of this License.
  </p><h3><a id="section2"></a>
    2. VERBATIM COPYING
  </h3><p>
    You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
    commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright
    notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the
    Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
    conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical
    measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the
    copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in
    exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you
    must also follow the conditions in section 3.
  </p><p>
    You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you
    may publicly display copies.
  </p><h3><a id="section3"></a>
    3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
  </h3><p>
    If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
    printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
    Document&#8217;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
    the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
    Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the
    back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
    publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title
    with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
    other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to
    the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy
    these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.
  </p><p>
    If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
    you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the
    actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
  </p><p>
    If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
    than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy
    along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
    computer-network location from which the general network-using public has
    access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete
    Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the
    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
    distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent
    copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
    year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
    through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
  </p><p>
    It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
    Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
    them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
  </p><h3><a id="section4"></a>
    4. MODIFICATIONS
  </h3><p>
    You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
    conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the
    Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version
    filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and
    modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In
    addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
  </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="A"><li class="listitem">
        Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
        from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which
        should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the
        Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the
        original publisher of that version gives permission.
      </li><li class="listitem">
        List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
        responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
        Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
        Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
        unless they release you from this requirement.
      </li><li class="listitem">
        State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified
        Version, as the publisher.
      </li><li class="listitem">
        Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
      </li><li class="listitem">
        Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to
        the other copyright notices.
      </li><li class="listitem">
        Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
        giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
        terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
      </li><li class="listitem">
        Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
        and required Cover Texts given in the Document&#8217;s license
        notice.
      </li><li class="listitem">
        Include an unaltered copy of this License.
      </li><li class="listitem">
        Preserve the section Entitled &#8220;History&#8221;, Preserve its
        Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
        authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title
        Page. If there is no section Entitled &#8220;History&#8221; in the
        Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher
        of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item
        describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.
      </li><li class="listitem">
        Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
        public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the
        network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was
        based on.  These may be placed in the &#8220;History&#8221;
        section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published
        at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
        publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
      </li><li class="listitem">
        For any section Entitled &#8220;Acknowledgements&#8221; or
        &#8220;Dedications&#8221;, Preserve the Title of the section, and
        preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the
        contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
      </li><li class="listitem">
        Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in
        their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are
        not considered part of the section titles.
      </li><li class="listitem">
        Delete any section Entitled &#8220;Endorsements&#8221;. Such a section
        may not be included in the Modified Version.
      </li><li class="listitem">
        Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
        &#8220;Endorsements&#8221; or to conflict in title with any Invariant
        Section.
      </li><li class="listitem">
        Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
      </li></ol></div><p>
    If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
    that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
    Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections
    as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant
    Sections in the Modified Version&#8217;s license notice. These titles
    must be distinct from any other section titles.
  </p><p>
    You may add a section Entitled &#8220;Endorsements&#8221;, provided it
    contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
    parties &#8212; for example, statements of peer review or that the text
    has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
    standard.
  </p><p>
    You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
    passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of
    Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text
    and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made
    by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the
    same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same
    entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
    replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher
    that added the old one.
  </p><p>
    The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
    permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
    endorsement of any Modified Version.
  </p><h3><a id="section5"></a>
    5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
  </h3><p>
    You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
    License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
    provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections
    of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as
    Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that
    you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
  </p><p>
    The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
    identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there
    are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents,
    make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in
    parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section
    if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section
    titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
    combined work.
  </p><p>
    In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
    &#8220;History&#8221; in the various original documents, forming one
    section Entitled &#8220;History&#8221;; likewise combine any sections
    Entitled &#8220;Acknowledgements&#8221;, and any sections Entitled
    &#8220;Dedications&#8221;. You must delete all sections Entitled
    &#8220;Endorsements&#8221;.
  </p><h3><a id="section6"></a>
    6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
  </h3><p>
    You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
    released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
    License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
    the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
    verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
  </p><p>
    You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
    it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
    License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other
    respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
  </p><h3><a id="section7"></a>
    7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
  </h3><p>
    A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
    independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
    distribution medium, is called an &#8220;aggregate&#8221; if the copyright
    resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of
    the compilation&#8217;s users beyond what the individual works
    permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does
    not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
    derivative works of the Document.
  </p><p>
    If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies
    of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire
    aggregate, the Document&#8217;s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that
    bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of
    covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear
    on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.
  </p><h3><a id="section8"></a>
    8. TRANSLATION
  </h3><p>
    Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
    translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing
    Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from
    their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all
    Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant
    Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the
    license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided
    that you also include the original English version of this License and the
    original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a
    disagreement between the translation and the original version of this
    License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
  </p><p>
    If a section in the Document is Entitled &#8220;Acknowledgements&#8221;,
    &#8220;Dedications&#8221;, or &#8220;History&#8221;, the requirement
    (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require
    changing the actual title.
  </p><h3><a id="section9"></a>
    9. TERMINATION
  </h3><p>
    You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as
    expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
    modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically
    terminate your rights under this License.
  </p><p>
    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
    from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless
    and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your
    license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you
    of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the
    cessation.
  </p><p>
    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
    permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
    reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of
    violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and
    you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
  </p><p>
    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
    licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this
    License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
    reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not
    give you any rights to use it.
  </p><h3><a id="section10"></a>
    10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
  </h3><p>
    The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU
    Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be
    similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
    address new problems or concerns. See
    <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/" target="_top">Copyleft</a>.
  </p><p>
    Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If
    the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License
    &#8220;or any later version&#8221; applies to it, you have the option of
    following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of
    any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free
    Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of
    this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft)
    by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy
    can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
    proxy&#8217;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
    authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.
  </p><h3><a id="section11"></a>
    11. RELICENSING
  </h3><p>
    &#8220;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&#8221; (or &#8220;MMC
    Site&#8221;) means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable
    works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those
    works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a
    server. A &#8220;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&#8221; (or
    &#8220;MMC&#8221;) contained in the site means any set of copyrightable
    works thus published on the MMC site.
  </p><p>
    &#8220;CC-BY-SA&#8221; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike
    3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
    corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
    California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published
    by that same organization.
  </p><p>
    &#8220;Incorporate&#8221; means to publish or republish a Document, in
    whole or in part, as part of another Document.
  </p><p>
    An MMC is &#8220;eligible for relicensing&#8221; if it is licensed under
    this License, and if all works that were first published under this
    License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in
    whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant
    sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.
  </p><p>
    The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
    under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
    provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.
  </p><h3><a id="addendum"></a>
    ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
  </h3><p>
    To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the
    License in the document and put the following copyright and license
    notices just after the title page:
  </p><pre class="screen">Copyright © YEAR YOUR NAME

Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the
terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no
Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in
the section entitled &#8220;GNU Free Documentation License&#8221;.</pre><p>
    If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
    replace the &#8220;with&#8230; Texts.&#8221; line with this:
  </p><pre class="screen">with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts
being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.</pre><p>
    If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
    combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
    situation.
  </p><p>
    If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
    recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
    software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their
    use in free software.
