@chapter Introduction

This manual describes how to use GNU
Backgammon to play and analyze backgammon games and
matches. It corresponds to version 1.00.0 (updated in August, 2013).

GNU Backgammon (gnubg)
plays and analyzes both money game sessions and tournament matches. It
evaluates and rolls out positions, and much more. Driven by a command-line
interface, it displays an ASCII rendering of a board on text-only terminals,
but also allows the user to play games and manipulate positions with a
graphical GTK+interface. GNU
Backgammon is extensible on platforms which support Python.


@example

@section Setup

Backgammon is a game for two players, played on a board consisting
of twenty-four narrow triangles called points. The triangles alternate
in color and are grouped into four quadrants of six triangles each. The
quadrants are referred to as a player's home board and outer board, and
the opponent's home board and outer board. The home and the outer boards
are separated from each other by a ridge down the center of the board
called the bar.

@end example

An alternate arrangement is the reverse of the one shown here, with
the home board on the left and the outer board on the right.

The points are numbered for either player starting in that player's
home board. The outermost point is the twenty-four point, which is also
the opponent's one point. Each player has fifteen checkers of his own
color. The initial arrangement of checkers is: two on each player's
twenty-four point, five on each player's thirteen point, three on each
player's eight point, and five on each player's six point.

Both players have their own pair of dice and a dice cup used for
shaking. A doubling cube, with the numerals 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 on
its faces, is used to keep track of the current stake of the game.

@node Object of the Game, Movement of the Checkers, Setup, Rules of the game

The object of the game is for a player to move all of his checkers
into his own home board and then bear them off. The first player to bear
off all of his checkers wins the game.

@node Movement of the Checkers, Hitting and Entering, Object of the Game, Rules of the game
@section Movement of the Checkers

To start the game, each player throws a single die. This determines
both the player to go first and the numbers to be played. If equal
numbers come up, then both players roll again until they roll different
numbers. The player throwing the higher number now moves his checkers
according to the numbers showing on both dice. After the first roll, the
players throw two dice and alternate turns.

The roll of the dice indicates how many points, or pips, the player
is to move his checkers. The checkers are always moved forward, to a
lower-numbered point. The following rules apply:

@enumerate 

@item
A checker may be moved only to an open point, one that is not
occupied by two or more opposing checkers. 

@item
The numbers on the two dice constitute separate moves. For
example, if a player rolls 5 and 3, he may move one checker five
spaces to an open point and another checker three spaces to an open
point, or he may move the one checker a total of eight spaces to an
open point, but only if the intermediate point (either three or five
spaces from the starting point) is also open.

@end example

@item
A player who rolls doubles plays the numbers shown on the dice
twice. A roll of 6 and 6 means that the player has four sixes to
use, and he may move any combination of checkers he feels
appropriate to complete this requirement. 

@item
A player must use both numbers of a roll if this is legally
possible (or all four numbers of a double). When only one number can
be played, the player must play that number. Or if either number can
be played but not both, the player must play the larger one. When
neither number can be used, the player loses his turn. In the case
of doubles, when all four numbers cannot be played, the player must
play as many numbers as he can. 
@end enumerate

@node Hitting and Entering, Bearing Off, Movement of the Checkers, Rules of the game
@section Hitting and Entering

A point occupied by a single checker of either color is called a
blot. If an opposing checker lands on a blot, the blot is hit and placed
on the bar.

Any time a player has one or more checkers on the bar, his first
obligation is to enter those checker(s) into the opposing home board. A
checker is entered by moving it to an open point corresponding to one of
the numbers on the rolled dice.

For example, if a player rolls 4 and 6, he may enter a checker onto
either the opponent's four point or six point, so long as the
prospective point is not occupied by two or more of the opponent's
checkers.

@end example

If White rolls [64] with a checker on the bar, he must enter the
checker onto Red's four point since Red's six point is not open. If
neither of the points is open, the player loses his turn. If a player is
able to enter some but not all of his checkers, he must enter as many as
he can and then forfeit the remainder of his turn.

After the last of a player's checkers has been entered, any unused
numbers on the dice must be played, by moving either the checker that
was entered or a different checker.

@node Bearing Off, Doubling, Hitting and Entering, Rules of the game
@section Bearing Off

Once a player has moved all of his fifteen checkers into his home
board, he may commence bearing off. A player bears off a checker by
rolling a number that corresponds to the point on which the checker
resides, and then removing that checker from the board. Thus, rolling a
6 permits the player to remove a checker from the six point.

If there is no checker on the point indicated by the roll, the
player must make a legal move using a checker on a higher-numbered
point. If there are no checkers on higher-numbered points, the player is
permitted (and required) to remove a checker from the highest point on
which one of his checkers resides. A player is under no obligation to
bear off if he can make an otherwise legal move.

@noindent

@end example

A player must have all of his active checkers in his home board in
order to bear off. If a checker is hit during the bear-off process, the
player must bring that checker back to his home board before continuing
to bear off. The first player to bear off all fifteen checkers wins the
game.

@node Doubling, Gammons and Backgammons, Bearing Off, Rules of the game
@section Doubling

Backgammon is played for an agreed stake per point. Each game starts
at one point. During the course of the game, a player who feels he has a
sufficient advantage may propose doubling the stakes. He may do this
only at the start of his own turn and before he has rolled the dice.

A player who is offered a double may refuse, in which case he
concedes the game and pays one point. Otherwise, he must accept the
double and play on for the new higher stakes. A player who accepts a
double becomes the owner of the cube and only he may make the next
double.

Subsequent doubles in the same game are called redoubles. If a
player refuses a redouble, he must pay the number of points that were at
stake prior to the redouble. Otherwise, he becomes the new owner of the
cube and the game continues at twice the previous stakes. There is no
limit to the number of redoubles in a game.

@node Gammons and Backgammons, Optional Rules, Doubling, Rules of the game
@section Gammons and Backgammons

At the end of the game, if the losing player has borne off at least
one checker, he loses only the value showing on the doubling cube (one
point, if there have been no doubles). However, if the loser has
@emph{not} borne off any of his checkers, he is gammoned
and loses @emph{twice} the value of the doubling cube. Or,
worse, if the loser has not borne off any of his checkers and still has
a checker on the bar or in the winner's home board, he is backgammoned
and loses @emph{three times} the value of the double
cube.

@node Optional Rules, Rules for Match Play, Gammons and Backgammons, Rules of the game
@section Optional Rules

The following optional rules are in widespread use.

@enumerate 

@item
Automatic doubles. If identical numbers are thrown on the first
roll, the stakes are doubled. The doubling cube is turned to 2 and
remains in the middle. Players usually agree to limit the number of
automatic doubles to one per game.

@item
Beavers. When a player is doubled, he may immediately redouble
(beaver) while retaining possession of the cube. The original
doubler has the option of accepting or refusing as with a normal
double. 

@item
The Jacoby Rule. Gammons and backgammons count only as a single
game if neither player has offered a double during the course of the
game. This rule speeds up play by eliminating situations where a
player avoids doubling so he can play on for a gammon. 
@end enumerate

@node Rules for Match Play, , Optional Rules, Rules of the game
@section Rules for Match Play

When backgammon tournaments are held to determine an overall winner,
the usual style of competition is match play. Competitors are paired
off, and each pair plays a series of games to decide which player
progresses to the next round of the tournament. This series of games is
called a match.

Matches are played to a specified number of points. The first player
to accumulate the required points wins the match. Points are awarded in
the usual manner: one for a single game, two for a gammon, and three for
a backgammon. The doubling cube is used, so the winner receives the value
of the game multiplied by the final value of the doubling cube.

Matches are normally played using the Crawford rule. The Crawford
rule states that if one player reaches a score one point short of the
match, neither player may offer a double in the immediately following
game. This one game with no doubling is called the Crawford game. If the
Crawford game is won by the trailing player then the doubling cube becomes
available in all subsequent games (and it's most often in the best
interests of the trailing player to double immediately in these games).

@end multitable

In this example, White and Black are playing a 5-point match. After
three games White has 4 points, which is just one point short of what he
needs. That triggers the Crawford rule which says there can be no
doubling in next game, Game 4.

There is no bonus for winning more than the required number of
points in match play. The sole goal is to win the match, and the size of
the victory doesn't matter.

Automatic doubles, beavers, and the Jacoby rule are not used in
match play.

One way to move the checkers is to click on a checker you want to
move and then drag it, while holding the mouse button down, to the
desired designation point. If you have the option Show target help
when dragging checkers enabled, you will see the a green guiding at
any legal target point for the checker you are dragging. You can find
this option by choosing Settings->Options...->Display

@node Moving checkers by clicking, Undo a move, Moving by drag and drop, Moving the checkers
@subsection Moving checkers by clicking

Move the mouse cursor over the checker you want to move. If you
now click the @emph{left} mouse button, the checker will
move the pips of the @emph{left} die. If you have
already moved one checker, clicking on a new checker will move it
according to the pips of the remaining die. If you click with the
@emph{right} mouse button on a checker, the checker
will move according to the @emph{right} die.

Using this method for moving the checkers can be really effective.
Some users prefer showing the higher die to the left. You can make
GNU Backgammon show the highest die to
the left if you choose  Settings -> Options... -> Dice  and check the check box labeled Show higher die on
left.

@node Undo a move, Some shortcuts, Moving checkers by clicking, Moving the checkers
@subsection Undo a move

Before you complete your move by clicking the dice, it's possible
to undo your moves and return to the position before any checkers have
been moved. You can either click the Undo button in the toolbar, or
you can choose  Edit -> Undo  from the menu or the keyboard shortcut @key{Ctrl}@key{Z}.

@node Some shortcuts, , Undo a move, Moving the checkers
@subsection Some shortcuts

There are some shortcuts for moving the checkers. You can
@emph{make a new point} by right clicking on the empty
point that you want to make. As an example, if you roll 31 as the
opening roll, and you want to play 8/5 6/5, you simply place the mouse
cursor on the 5-point and right click. Making points this way also
works if you hit a checker, and with doubles.

Another shortcut can be used in the bearoff phase of the game. By
clicking in the bearoff tray, @emph{two checkers will be born
off} if such a move is legal.

GNU Backgammon can auto play forced
moves for you. This feature can be enabled by choosing  Settings -> Options... -> Game , and then check the box Play forced moves

press the Hint button in the tool bar or the menu option
Analyze->Hint.
This will open a hint window.

@noindent
@anchor{The hint window}

@strong{The hint window}

[[hintwindow.png]]

This Hint window shows a list of all possible moves for the position
and dice roll. The different moves are sorted by how GNU
Backgammon ranks each move; there is one move on each
line in the list. The rest of the numbers may look a bit complicated and
cryptic but, once you learn what each number means, it isn't really that
bad.

@enumerate 

@item
@emph{Rank} is the number that shows
GNU Backgammon's rank of the move. All
moves evaluated at a given ply are ranked above those evaluated at a
lesser ply. If you use the 0, 1, 2, etc, buttons below the hint list
to re-evaluate one or more moves, the moves will be moved
accordingly. Therefore, for accurate results when re-evaluating a
move that you are interested in, it is usually best to
@emph{re-evaluate all moves above it in the list}.
(And slipping with the mouse and re-evaluating, e.g., a 3-ply move
at 2-ply may make the move @emph{disappear} down to
the bottom of the list!) 

@item
@emph{Type} is a description of the evaluation
that was used to calculate the results. Cubeful means that it is
taking into account the possibility that someone may double.
Occasionally you may see several moves with the equity of -1.000,
(See @emph{Equity} below), despite significantly
different winning percentiles. This is because it thinks that if any
of these moves are played then the opponent will double and you
should pass. The n-ply is the depth to which GNU
Backgammon analyzed the move. 

@item
@emph{Win} is the fractions of games that
GNU Backgammon thinks will be won by a
single game, gammon or backgammon. 

@item
@emph{Wg} is the fractions of games that
GNU Backgammon thinks will be won by a
gammon or backgammon. 

@item
@emph{Wbg} is the fractions of games that
GNU Backgammon thinks will be won by a
backgammon. 

@item
@emph{Lose} is the fractions of games that
GNU Backgammon thinks will be lost by a
single game, gammon or backgammon. (Notice that this number is equal
to 1 - Win) 

@item
@emph{Lg} is the fractions of games that
GNU Backgammon thinks will be lost by a
gammon or backgammon. 

@item
@emph{Lbg} is the fractions of games that
GNU Backgammon thinks will be lost by a
backgammon. 

@item
@emph{Equity} is the overall evaluation of the
position by the program, after considering the different win/loss
percentiles, the cube position, and the match score. A 1.000 would
mean that you are expected to win a point, a 0.000 would mean that
it is roughly equal, and a -1.000 that you are expected to lose a
point. When the evaluation is cubeful this number is not computable
by the win/loss brake down of the previous columns. 

@item
@emph{Diff.} is the difference in equity,
perceived in comparison to the top ranked move. 

@item
@emph{Move} is the move being evaluated. In the
case of a red line, it is the move that was played.

@subsection Getting cube decision hints while playing

If you're thinking about a cube decision before rolling you can
press the same Hint button in the toolbar, as you pressed when you
wanted checker play hint. The hint window will again appear, but this
time it will look a bit different and it will show a hint of the correct
cube decision.

@noindent
@anchor{The cube hint window}

@strong{The cube hint window}

[[hintcubewindow.png]]

The first lines is the window dialog shows the evaluation depth, and
the cubeless equity with the evaluated probabilities. This equity is
compensated for the match score. The cubeless equity for a money game,
where the the calculation of equity is not compensated for match score,
is also reported.

Next follow three lines with cubeful equities. In figure above, the
cubeful equity for the player on roll for not doubling at this turn, is
+0.123. The equity for a double and the opponent passing is (of course)
+1.000, since the player then will win one point. (The number is
normalized to cube value of one, so even if it is a redouble to 4 or 8
or higher, the cubeful equity for double/pass is still +1.000 for the
doubler.) The third number in figure above is the cubeful equity for the
player doubling and the opponent accepting the double. The different
option will be listed in order with the best option highest. The number
right to the listed equities is the differences from the cube decision
considered best.

The last line states the best considered cube action. In the figure
above, GNU Backgammon considers the best cube
action to be No double, take. When percentage number right to the proper
cube action, is a number which indicates the @emph{bluff}
potential. It is the necessary percentage chance you think you can bluff
your opponent into passing the cube to make the double theoretically
correct. This number is only available when the position is considered
No double, take or Too good to double, pass.

@node The hint tool buttons, , Getting cube decision hints while playing, Getting hints manually
@subsection The hint tool buttons

As you may see in both figures above, there is a set of buttons
below the move list or cube analysis. Here follows a short description
of what each of the buttons does:

@enumerate 

@item
@emph{Eval} will evaluate the selected moves, or
the cube decision with the current evaluation setting. 

@item
@emph{...} will open the evaluation setting
dialog. You can then modify the evaluation setting. More about
evaluation settings in the next chapter. 

@item
@emph{0 1 2 3 4} will evaluate the selected moves
or cube decision at cubeful 0-ply or cubeful 1-ply or cubeful 2-ply
and so on. 

@item
@emph{Rollout} will start a rollout ((A
@emph{rollout} is simply a Monte Carlo simulation of
a backgammon position. More about rollouts in a later chapter.)) of
the selected moves or cube decision. 

@item
@emph{...} will open the rollout settings dialog.
This dialog will be further described later in this manual. 

@item
@emph{MWC} (Match Winning Chance). If this button
is pressed the values in the hint window will be shown as the chance
to win the whole match. If this button is unpressed or there is a
money game that's played, the values in the hint window is reported
as Equity. Notice, The equity in a match is actually a recalculation
from match winning chance to equity. This recalculated number is
often referred to as EMG, Equivalent to Money Game. The EMG number
is comparable to the equity in a money game, and are therefore
labeled 'Equity'. 

@item
@emph{Show} will show the board as it would be
after the selected move is made. The button is only available in the
checker play hint window. 

@item
@emph{Move} will make the move selected in the
list. It's also possible to make a move directly from the list by
double clicking on the move. The button is also available only in
the checker play hint window. 

@item
@emph{Copy} will copy the text of all selected
moves to clipboard. 

@item
@emph{Temp. Map} will show Sho Sengoku's

[[tutor.png]]

In Tutor Mode, GNU Backgammon will
analyze your moves and/or cube decisions and compare them with its
choices. You set the threshold for its alerts, for example, if you set
it for bad then it will only warn you when you make a bad mistake. It
will then allow you to re-examine your choice, go right ahead with it,
or provide a 'hint' - essentially, showing you its analysis.

The tutor can give warnings on both cube decisions and checker play.
If you want the tutor to only warn on cube decisions, you can uncheck
the box for the Checker play. Likewise, if you want it to only warn on
checker play decisions, you can uncheck the box for the Cube decisions.

@noindent

In the above figure, you can see a warning dialog from the tutor
mode. If you press the button labeled Play anyway, the move you made
will be kept and the game will continue. If you press the Rethink
button, the dialog will close and the checkers that you moved will be
returned to their original positions. You can then rethink the position
and try an alternative move. Keep doing this until the Tutor accepts
your move as being good enough. Alternatively you can press the Hint
button to show the hint window with its list of possible moves and their
evaluations. Finally, if you press the End Tutor Mode button, the dialog
will close and turn Tutor Mode off.

A similar warning window will also appear for poor cube

If your Edit button in the toolbar is disabled it is because there
is no game or match in progress. With the current state of
GNU Backgammon there must be a game or
match in progress to be able to enter edit mode. (This may change in the
future.) If there is no game in progress and you want to set up a

the toolbar.

When you are in edit mode you will see the the text (Editing) in the
match information box below the board.

Setting up a position is basically done by editing the current
position. The editing it self is controlled by clicking different areas
of the board and may not be obvious at first hand.

@node Clearing the board, Quick edit, Editing, Setting up a position
@section Clearing the board

In edit mode you can easily clear the board by clicking in one of
the bearoff trays. It's often easier to start setting up a position with
a empty board, so this feature is really handy. When you click on one of
the bearoff tray, all checkers will be moved to the bearoff.

@node Quick edit, Editing by drag and drop, Clearing the board, Setting up a position
@section Quick edit

The default method of editing a position is called @emph{Quick
edit}. It's based on clicking on the point where you want to
place checkers. The number of checkers placed on the point is depending
on where you click, for example if you want to place 3 checkers on a
point, clicking on the location where the third checker would go places
3 checkers. This method should be familiar to Snowie users.

Clicking with the left button places checkers for player1, clicking
with the right button places checkers for player2. If you want to place
more than 5 checkers, click multiple times on the tip of the point. To
clear a point, click on the border of the board below or above the point
- depending on if the point is in the lower or top half of the board.
The bar works just like normal points - the more you click to the middle
of the bar, the more checkers will be placed there.

@node Editing by drag and drop, Setting the player on turn, Quick edit, Setting up a position
@section Editing by drag and drop

There is also a different way of editing the checker positions. You
can drag and drop checkers around the board while you're holding down
the Ctrl key on your keyboard. Press the Ctrl key and hold it down. Then
left-click the checker you want to drag to another point and drag it
with the mouse, (while holding down the Ctrl key and the left mouse
button), to the destination point. You can drag checkers to open points
or to points where you have checkers of the same color. You can also
'hit' opponent blots with the drag and drop edit method.

This method of editing comes handy when there is just a small
adjustment to be done in the position.

@node Setting the player on turn, Setting the dice, Editing by drag and drop, Setting up a position

[[initialboard.png]]

Note that setting the turn sets the turn before the dice has been
rolled. If there is a dice present at the board, setting the turn will
remove the dice rolled. In this way you can set up a position to be a
cube decision evaluation instead of a move decision evaluation.

The turn can also be set by choosing Game->Set turn. Both these methods for setting the player on turn can
also be used without being in edit mode.

@node Setting the dice, Setting the cube, Setting the player on turn, Setting up a position
@section Setting the dice

You can set the dice for a player by clicking in the middle part of
the board where you usually click when you roll the dice while playing.
Click in the middle of the right playing area to set the dice for player
0, the bottom player. Click the left dice rolling area to set the dice
for player 1, the top player. Once you click one of these areas the dice
selection widget will appear and you can select a dice roll by clicking
on a dice pair.

@noindent

Setting the dice in edit mode sets both dice and the player on turn.
Setting the dice for player 0, will make player 0 on turn with that
specific dice roll to play.

This method for setting the dice roll only works in edit mode. If
you're not in edit mode you can set the dice by choosing Game->Set dice... from the menu, however this will set the dice for the
player on turn.

@node Setting the cube, Setting the score, Setting the dice, Setting up a position
@section Setting the cube

Setting the cube is quite simple while you're in edit mode. Simply
click the cube in the board and the cube selection widget appears.

Selecting a cube in the first row, where the number is displayed
up-side-down, the top player will be the cube owner. The value of the
cube will be the value of the cube you click in the widget. Note that
the unturned cube is the leftmost cube labeled 64, just as it usually is
on real doubling cube.

@node Setting the score, Exiting Edit mode, Setting the cube, Setting up a position
@section Setting the score

Very often i backgammon the match score does matter on how the
position is evaluated. GNU Backgammon's
evaluation algorithms does take the score into account. You can
therefore adjust the the match length and the score to each player while
you're in edit mode.

In the figure you see that the score fields are editable while
you're in edit mode. Insert the desired match score for each player in
these fields. Player 0, the top player, has the left score field and
player 1, the bottom player, has the right score. You can also set the
match score in the in the match field to the right. There is also a box
to tick whenever the position is from a Crawford game.

If you want the computer to do a money game evaluation of the
position, you should set the match score to 0 (zero).

After you have successfully set up the position you desire, you can
now analyze the position. You can click Hint in the toolbar to get the
best move of cube decision in the same way as described in the chapter
called @ref{Playing a game}. Hint, rollouts and evaluations done
from the hint window will not be saved if you try to save the position.
If you want to analyze the position and then be able to save the
position and the analysis results you should rather do a move and then
click back to the move and then choose Analyze->Analyze move for the menu. You can then work in the analysis pane on
the right side instead of in the hint window.

You can enter checkers on a point by clicking on the point. Notice
the amount of checkers you add on a point, depends on where on that
point you click. Left mouse button, black checkers and right mouse
button, red checkers. (assuming you didn't change the colors). You will
get used to this editing. and it makes it much faster to set up a
position.

@subsection The Smart Game Format

GNU Backgammon uses the Smart Game
Format (SGF) to store games, matches, sessions and positions. SGF is
used in as a standard format for several other turn based games. The
SGF files can store all the rolls and moves and cube decisions as well
as commentary and analysis.

A game that uses SGF extensively is Go. The format is described
at @uref{http://www.red-bean.com/sgf/,this site}.

@node Opening and importing matches, Saving and exporting positions; games or matches, The Smart Game Format, Retrieving and storing backgammon files
@subsection Opening and importing matches

Since version 0.16 the GUI recognizes all importable files
automatically (with the exception of the FIBS format). To open or
import a file choose File->Open. A file dialog box will appear where you can select the
file and the dialog will inform you of the recognized format, if the
file is importable. You can also use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl-O, or
the tool bar button labeled Open, to open the file dialog box
directly.

It is still possible to import an unrecognized file by using the
underlying command line interface. Enable the command pane by choosing View->Command. In the command pane type in @code{import oldmoves
<filepath>} to import, e.g., an oldmoves fibs
formatted file.

The following table contains the supported formats and the
corresponding commands for manual import of a file.

Jellyfish Match is not formally defined and software exporting matches to this format often produce minor discrepancies.
GNU Backgammon tries to cater to most of them automatically.

Online sites do not always create their .mat files with the you as player 1, the one playing towards the bottom of the board.
To have these matches converted to be displayed in the natural way, you can use de CLI command
@code{set aliases <player name 1>;<player name 2>;[<etc...>]}
GNU Backgammon will swap the players as needed so that player names matching these aliases are always imported as player 1.

@node Saving and exporting positions; games or matches, , Opening and importing matches, Retrieving and storing backgammon files
@subsection Saving and exporting positions, games or matches

If you have played or imported a match into GNU
Backgammon, and wish to save your efforts, you can
choose File->Save. A file dialog box will appear and you can type in a
file name or keep the suggested default file name. (The suggested
default file name contains the date, the players name and the length
of the match). This will save the whole match of the current match or
session. If there is any analysis or commentary available this will
also be saved to the file. You can also use the tool bar button
labeled Save to open the file dialog box directly. There is also a
keyboard shortcut, Ctrl-S, for saving a match or session.

The export dialog is accessed by choosing File->Export This dialog is similar to the save dialog. Again you may
choose a different filename and whether to export an entire match, a
game or a position. Then you must choose an export format as well.
Notice some file formats only supports export of matches and some only
supports position. Only when a legal combination is chosen will ending
the dialog be possible. The following table contains the supported
file formats and the corresponding commands for export. Again notice
that with some formats only some of M(atch), G(ame), P(osition) is
allowed. For example to export a Jellyfish position you would issue
the command @code{export position pos

@subsubsection HTML export

GNU Backgammon can export the current
position, game, match or session in HTML if you wish to publish it
on the web. 

GNU Backgammon exports in validating
XHTML 1.0 with the use of CSS style sheets. You may add your own
style sheet to the exported HTML files if you wish to override the
default layout, e.g., change colors or fonts.

The board is made up from hundreds of pictures. Currently, you
can choose between three different sets of pictures:

@enumerate 

@item
the BBS images used by Kit Woolsey's GammOnLine e-magazine,
Danish Backgammon Federation's web-based discussion group and
others 

@item
the fibs2html images used by the Joseph Heled's program
@uref{http://fibs2html.sourceforge.net/,fibs2html}

@item
images generated by GNU
Backgammon itself. 
@end enumerate

The images generated by GNU
Backgammon will use your current board design in
GNU Backgammon, and honors your
settings on clockwise or anti-clockwise movement and board numbering
(on, off, dynamic).

If you export a match or session to HTML, GNU
Backgammon will write the individual games to
separate files. For example, if you export to file foo.html the
first game is exported to foo.html, the second game to foo_002.html,
the third game to foo_003.html and so forth.

The output from the HTML export can be customized. For example,
it's possible to leave out the analysis or parts of the analysis.
Also, you may enter a specific URL to the pictures used to compose
the board which is useful for posting positions on web-based
discussion groups such as Kit Woolsey's GammOnLine, the Danish
Backgammon Federation's Debat Forum.

If you want to have html images locally on your computer, you
can have GNU Backgammon generate these.
The html images will be generated based on the current appearance
settings. You can also control the size of the images in the export
settings dialog (To get the export settings dialog you can select in
the menu Settings->Export.... Select the size of your html images at the bottom
right in this dialog

To start the generation of the html images, select in the menu File->Export->HTML images.... In the file dialog box, you can select a
@emph{directory} where the images will be generated.
The images are stored in PNG format.

To generate images for the command line, use the command:

export htmlimages directory

where directory is the directory where you want your images to
be created.

@node LaTeX export, , HTML export, Saving and exporting positions; games or matches
@subsubsection LaTeX export

GNU Backgammon can export games,
match and positions to the document typesetting system LaTeX. For
exporting a match or session to LaTeX

The LaTeX export will export all board diagrams and analysis if
available. The produced documents can therefore be quite large. Note
that the LaTeX file produced needs the eepic package. You can get
this package at your nearest CTAN mirror((The produced LaTeX file
also needs epic, textcomp and ucs, but these are more common in
LaTeX distributions so you probably already have these.)).

You can not export a position to LaTeX. (At least not yet!)
However, you can export a position to EPS and include this EPS file
in your LaTeX document.

@node Entering live tournament matches, Analyzing matches, Retrieving and storing backgammon files, Working with matches
@section Entering live tournament matches

It's possible to enter match transcriptions into GNU
Backgammon. It's not very difficult. Presuming you're
using the GUI, do this:

@enumerate 

@item
Start a match of any length, pressing the New button, and select
Human-Human and manual dice. 

@item
To select the opening roll, click on the right dice pair in the
dice selection window that appears. The left die in the dice pair is
the die that's rolled by player 0, or the player at the top. The
right die is the die that will be rolled by player 1 or the bottom
player. So if you select for example the 53 dice combination it
means that player 0 rolls a 5 and player 1 rolls a 3, and player 0
is therefore beginning this game. However, if you select the 35 dice
combination it means that player 0 rolls a 3 and player 1 rolls a 5.
Player 1 will therefore begin when you select 53 instead of 35.

@item
To change the names, use the Edit button at the top. If you want
to enter information such as the name of the Annotator, date,
locale, etc. go to the Game menu and choose Match Information.

@item
To enter written comments, you first have to play the move, and
then go back to the move in the move list to be able to use the
Commentary pane (feel free to close the Messages pane from the
Windows menu). Don't forget to save the match every once in a while.

@item
One comment: when entering the Cube commentary of a cube play
(meaning it was turned), select the Take/Pass decision to enter the
commentary. The reason is that if you export it after, and didn't do
this, the commentary appears before the cube decision and not after
as it should. 
@end enumerate

Tip: while entering the match, if you wish to see GNU
Backgammon's opinion while you are entering the moves,
play the move on the board and press the Hint button in the tool bar. In
the latest builds, if you have done this, the results will then be
placed with the move so that it means it is already analyzed when you
run the full match analysis. Mind you, it will preserve the information
even if you ran a deeper 3-ply or 4-ply from the Hint window. After
playing the move and confirming the dice, go back in the move list and
click on the move, and you'll see the analysis appear in the Analysis
pane as it should.

@section Analyzing matches

GNU Backgammon can analyze your matches
for skill and luck. If you have an open match (as a result of playing,
loading or importing), the analysis is started by choosing Analyze->Analyze match. You should now see a progress bar at the bottom right
corner of the main interface window while the computer is busy
analyzing. During this time you won't be able to interact with the
program other than to quit the analysis. The analysis is complete when
the progress bar disappears and you hear a small sound. Now, you would
probably like to view the result of the analysis. This can be done in
terms of overall statistics by choosing Analyze->Match statistics, or in detail by browsing through the match. More on these
subjects in the upcoming sections.

You can also analyze just the current game, by choosing Analyze->Analyze game. If you're only interested in the analysis of the current
move, you can select Analyze->Analyze move.

@menu

You can configure how GNU Backgammon
analysis the match or game for you. This can be configured in the dialog
box that appears when choose Settings->Analysis.

@noindent
@anchor{Analyze settings dialog}

@strong{Analyze settings dialog}

[[analysesettings.png]]

In the top left frame in this dialog box, you can select what to

three different properties in a match.

@enumerate 

@item

@item
Cube decisions 

@item

@end enumerate

In addition you can have the analysis to analyze just one of the
players, or both. There is also possible to set a limit of how many
moves to be analyzed at each position. When you're reviewing your match,
the number of analyzed moves will be limited to number in this field.
However, if you want to analyze further moves in a particular position,
it's not a problem to do that later. The move that was actually done in
the match will be analyzed even if it is ranked below the number of
moves limit.

GNU Backgammon will also mark each move
or cube decision with Doubtful, Bad and Very bad. You can adjust the
limits in equity difference for which label to assign. This is done in
the frame box to the left. Notice, currently the Good and Very good
classes are not used.

You can also adjust the classes for what GNU
Backgammon considers lucky and unlucky rolls. The luck of
a roll is defined as the difference of equity after the best move after
rolled dice and the equity after best move averaged over all possible
rolls.

The right part of the dialog box is an evaluation setting for how
each move or cube decision should be evaluated in the analysis. For an
explanation of this settings, see the chapter called "[[Evaluation
settings]]".

When a match is analyzed in GNU
Backgammon you should open the @emph{game

be docked into the right side panel. If you want it docked into the
right side panel you should check on Window->Dock panels. The game record window shows a list of all the moves in
the game. You can also navigate between the games and moves.

@noindent

[[gamerecord.png]]

The figure shows a typical game record list. The moves are shown
in two columns. The left column shows the moves for player 0,the to
player, and the right column shows the moves of player 1, the bottom
player. You can navigate through the game with the arrow buttons at
the top of the game record. The red buttons with the double arrows
take you to the previous game or the next match. (Arrow pointing to
the left takes you to the previous game, and the red arrow pointing to
the right takes you to the next game.) The green buttons take you one
move ahead in the game or one move back. The green arrow button
pointing to the right take you to the previous move. The green arrow
button pointing to the right take you to the next move or to the next
dice roll. If your in the move list where the dice is not rolled, a
click on this green Next button will show you the same position with
the dice rolled. The last two buttons take you to the next marked
move, or to the previous marked move. The green arrow button with a
question mark pointing to the left will take you to the previous
marked move. The green arrow button with a question mark pointing to
the right will take you to the next marked move. You can also go to
other games in the match or session by selecting the game in the game
drop down menu. You can also go to a move directly by clicking that
move in the game record list.

There is also some keyboard shortcuts for navigating through the
match. Page Down till take you to the next move and Page up will take
you to the previous move.

After a analysis some of the move in the game list will be marked.
You will see some moves marked with @emph{?} and some
with @emph{?!} and some with @emph{??}.
These marks means the same as the marks in normal chess notation.

same as the Hint window described in the "[[Playing a game or match]]"
chapter.

@noindent
@anchor{The Analyze pane}

@strong{The Analyze pane}

[[analasyepane.png]]

In the figure you can see the analysis panel. At the top of the
analysis panel you will see three pull-down menus. The leftmost
pull-down menu is a comment on the cube decision. In the figure it is
a position where the player didn't double and the GNU
Backgammon's analysis of this is empty. There was
nothing wrong with not doubling in this position. The user can also
override GNU Backgammon's evaluation and
mark the cube decision as 'Doubtful', 'Bad' or 'Very bad'. Note that
the cube decision pull-down menu will only be visible when the player
has the cube available.

The next pull-down menu shows a simple analysis of the roll. The
roll in this position was 32. GNU
Backgammon's evaluation of this dice roll is also empty.
It shows that this particular roll was -.162 equity worse than the
average roll. This means that the roll is a bit unlucky, but does not
qualify for being marked as an unlucky roll. The rolls are marked in
these categories: 'Very lucky', 'Lucky', 'Unlucky' and 'Very unlucky'.

The rightmost pull-down menu, shows the move which was done. In
this situation the move that was done was 3/off 2/off. This move did
not qualify for any mark. Moves that GNU
Backgammon don't like will be marked as 'Doubtful',
'Bad' or 'Very bad'. The user can also override GNU
Backgammon's evaluation and mark the move manually
with the pull-down menu.

The rest of the analysis window is a notebook of two pages. The
first page is the list of possible moves. The list is sorted in the
ranked order with the best considered move at the top. The moves are
sorted by equity or EMG. In the list in the figure there is only two
possible moves. The move that was actually done in the match, is
marked with red color. The only difference of this list of moves and
the list of moves in the hint window, is that this list does not show
the probabilities for each outcome of the game. If you want to see the
probabilities of the different outcomes, you can click on the button
labeled Details. This will then show you a list with these numbers.

The other page of the notebook is the cube decision analysis. This
analysis show exactly the same as in the Hint window described in the
chapter called "[[Playing a game or match]]". Note that the cube
decision page will only be available if there is a cube decision. It
will not be visible if the cube is not available to the player.

There is also a set of tool buttons in the analysis panel. These
buttons does exactly the same as the tool buttons in the Hint window,
which is described in the the chapter called "[[Playing a game or
match]]".

@enumerate 

@item
Total moves: The total number of moves in the match. 

@item
Unforced moves: The number of unforced moves, i.e., all
checker play decisions which had more than one legal move.

@item
Moves marked @emph{xxx}: The number of moves
marked @emph{very good}, @emph{very
bad} etc. The analysis will mark moves @emph{very
bad}, @emph{bad} etc. based on the
threshold you've defined in the analysis settings.
GNU Backgammon can currently not
automatically mark moves, e.g., @emph{good}, but
you can mark moves @emph{good} yourself. 

@item
Error rate (total): The first number is the total amount of
normalized equity that the player gave up during this game or
match. The number in parenthesis is the un-normalized
counterpart; for money play the all errors are multiplied with
the value of the cube, and for match play the total match
winning chance given up by the player is reported. 

@item
Error rate (per move): The error rate per move is the total
error rate divided by the number of @emph{unforced
moves}. Note that is different from Snowie 4 that
defines the error rate per move as the total error rate divided
by the total number of moves for both players, i.e., the sum of
@emph{total moves} for both players. In general,
your error rate per move will be lower in Snowie than in
GNU Backgammon. 

@item
Checker play rating: GNU
Backgammon will assign a rating for your checker
play ranging from @emph{Awful!} to
@emph{Supernatural}. See the description for the
overall rating below.

distributed her luck. The following information is available:

@enumerate 

@item
Rolls marked @emph{xxx}: The number of moves
marked @emph{very lucky},
@emph{lucky} etc. Moves marked @emph{very
lucky} are huge jokers that improve your equity with
more the +0.6 relative to the average equity. GNU
Backgammon normally uses cubeful 0-ply
evaluations to calculate the luck, but you can change that under
the analysis settings. See below for a complete overview of what
is considered @emph{very lucky},

This section provides a summary of the cube decision statistics:
the number of cube decisions, missed doubles, etc.

@enumerate 

@item
Total cube decisions: The total number of cube decisions,
i.e., the sum of no-doubles, doubles, takes, and passes. 

@item
Close or actual cube decisions: Similar to Total cube
decisions, except that no-doubles are only included if they're
considered @emph{close}. GNU
Backgammon considers a cube decision close if
the relevant equities are within 0.16 from each other or if the
position is too good. 

@item
Doubles, Takes, Passes: The total number of doubles, takes,
and passes in the game or match. 

@item
Missed doubles around DP, Missed doubles around TG: The
number of missed doubles around the double point and too good
point respectively. If the equity is below 0.95 the position is
considered to be around the double point else it considered to
be around the too good point. If you miss doubles around the
double point, it usually means that you double too late, whereas
missed doubles around the too good point means that you're too
greedy and play on for gammon when the position is
@emph{not} too good. 

@item
Wrong doubles around DP, Wrong doubles around TG: The number
of wrong doubles around the double point and too good point,
respectively. If you have wrong doubles around the double point
that generally means that you double too early where you really
should hold the cube, whereas wrong doubles around the too good
point means that you double positions where you really should
play on for a gammon or backgammon. 

@item
Wrong takes, Wrong passes: The total number of wrong takes
and passes, respectively. 

@item
Error rate (total): The accumulated cube errors for this
game or match reported both normalized and unnormalized. 

@item
Error rate (per cube decision): The error rate per cube
decision is the total error rate divided by the number of
@emph{close or actual cube decisions}. Note that
is different from Snowie 4 that defines the error rate per cube
decision as the total error rate divided by the total number of
moves for both players. In general, your error rate per cube
decision will be lower in Snowie than in GNU
Backgammon. Note that the reported number is
multiplied by 1000 in the default settings. 

@item
Cube decision rating: GNU
Backgammon will assign a rating for your cube
decisions ranging from @emph{Awful!} to
@emph{Supernatural}. See the description for the

@subsubsection Overall rating

The last section is the overall summary.

@enumerate 

@item
Error rate (total): The accumulated checker play and cube
decision errors reported by normalized and unnormalized. 

@item
Error rate (per decision): The error rate per decision is
the total error rate divided by the number of non-trivial
decisions (i.e., the sum of @emph{unforced moves}
and @emph{close or actual cube decisions}). Again,
please note that is different from Snowie 4 that defines the
error rate per decision as the total error rate divided by the
total number of moves for both players. In general, your error
rate per move will be lower in Snowie than in GNU
Backgammon. An investigation of approximately
300 matches showed the on average the GNU
Backgammon error rate with be 1.4 times higher
than your Snowie 4 error rate. 

@item
Equivalent Snowie error rate: For easy comparison
GNU Backgammon will also print the
total error rate calculated by the same formula as Snowie 4.

@item
Overall rating: Based on your normalized error rate per move
GNU Backgammon will assign you a rating ranging from
@emph{Awful!} to
@emph{Supernatural}. See the table below for the
thresholds. 

@item
Actual result: The actual result of the game or match. For
money game this is simply the number of points won or lost
during the game or match. For match play the number is
calculated as 50% added to the result of the game or match in
MWC. For example, losing a match or winning a match corresponds
to an actual result of 0% and 100%, respectively. Winning 1
point in the first game of 7 point match is worth 6% using Kit
Woolsey's match equity table, hence the actual result is 56%.

@item
Luck adjusted result: The luck adjusted result is calculated
as the @emph{actual result} plus the total
unnormalized luck rate. This is also called @emph{variance
reduction of skill} as described in Douglas Zare's
excellent article @uref{http://www.bkgm.com/articles/Zare/HedgingTowardSkill.html,  Hedging Toward Skill}. This should give an unbiased
measure of the strengths of the players. 

@item
MWC against current opponent: For match play
GNU Backgammon will calculate your
MWC against the current opponent. The number is calculated as
50% - your total unnormalized error rate + your opponent's total
unnormalized error rate. If your opponent is really lucky but
plays rather bad, this number can become larger than 100%, since
he due to the extra luck has the possibly to give up even more
MWC. However, GNU Backgammon will
report this number as 100%, and 0% for the opposite situation.
Note that this number is biased towards the analyzing bot, e.g.,
a 0-ply analysis a game between GNU Backgammon 2-ply and 0-ply
will suggest that 0-ply is a favorite, which it is clearly not.
For an unbiased measure use the @emph{luck adjusted
result} above.

@section Introduction to rollouts

The million dollar question is simple enough: out of all the games
that could result from playing this position, how many do we win (and
how many of our wins and losses are gammons, and how many are
backgammons)? The model is exactly the same as if we had an urn with a
googol balls in it (it's a big urn), and many of the balls have win
written on them, and some say gammon loss, and if we look hard enough
there are a few that read backgammon win, and so on. (Balls and urns
are to probability theorists what teapots and checkerboards are to
computer graphics researchers, or @emph{squeamish
ossifrage} is to cryptographers; they seem to come with the
territory.) Instead of having the patience to count the googol balls,
we just give the urn a really good shake and then pull 100 balls out
without looking, and say for instance "Well, I got 53 wins, 31 losses, 9
gammon wins, 6 gammon losses, and a backgammon win. It looks like my
equity's roughly +0.26." and go home. If we were a bit more thorough, we
could go a bit further and figure out that by cheating and measuring the
sample proportions instead of the population proportions, we introduced
a standard error of 0.06 into our result. (Of course, the trick is to
select a sample size that's big enough that you reduce the standard
error to a tolerable level, but small enough that the answer arrives
before you get bored.)

It will come as no surprise that a rollout with a limited number of
trials follows exactly the same procedure. It's sufficient to say that
the proportion of wins/gammons etc. that come up when GNU
Backgammon plays against itself (say) 1296 times, aren't
likely to vary all that much from the proportion we would get if we
measured the proportion of results in every game we could possibly get
of GNU Backgammon playing against itself. (Of
course, there may still be some doubt whether the results of
GNU Backgammon vs. GNU
Backgammon are representative of the results of a
perfect player vs. a perfect player, or of you vs. Joe Average, but
that's another story.)

@node Rollouts in GNU Backgammon, , Introduction to rollouts, Rollouts
@section Rollouts in GNU Backgammon

In GNU Backgammon the Rollout function
implements the procedure described above, with the following
improvements:

@enumerate 

@item
Truncation: instead of rolling out all the way to the end of the
game, it can stop and pretend its evaluation after a few plies is
perfect. This may obviously introduce some amount of systematic
error, but in practice this may not matter because: 

@item
it makes rollouts much faster, which means you can do more of
them (and thus trade sampling error for systematic error); 

@item
different positions will be reached in different trials, so the
correlation between errors in each trial weakens and the errors
cancel out to some extent; 

@item
if you are rolling out the positions after making different
plays, then any remaining systematic error between the two rollouts
is likely to be somewhat correlated and so the error in the
comparison between the plays is hopefully small. This implies that
truncated rollouts are better for estimating
@emph{relative} equity (@emph{which is the better
move here, 13/10*/9 or 13/10* 6/5*?}) than
@emph{absolute} equity (@emph{at this match
score I need 29% wins to accept a dead cube; can I take in this
position?}). 

@item
Race database truncation: when the game enters its 2-sided
bearoff database, GNU Backgammon can
estimate the probability of winning from that position with no error
at all (it can play and evaluate endgame positions perfectly), which
saves time and avoids introducing the errors that can result from
large equity variances at the end of the game. 

@item
Variance reduction: when using lookahead evaluations, it can
reduce errors by making use of the equity difference from one ply to
the next. (This can be interpreted as either canceling out the
estimated @emph{luck} (i.e. the difference in equity
evaluations before and after rolling) or using subsequent
evaluations to estimate the error in prior ones; the two views are
equivalent). GNU Backgammon automatically
performs variance reduction when looking ahead at least one ply.

@item
Stratified sampling: uses quasi-random number generation instead
of pseudo-random number generation (this is a standard technique in
Monte Carlo simulations where having a near-perfect uniform
distribution in your sample is more important than
unpredictability). GNU Backgammon only
stratifies the first 2 plies of a rollout, though it would be easy
enough to extend it to the remainder. 
@end enumerate

@menu
* Quasi-Random Dice::
@end menu

@node Quasi-Random Dice, , , Rollouts in GNU Backgammon
@subsection Quasi-Random Dice

Quasi-Random Dice are used to reduce the element of luck in
rollouts. Instead of selecting purely random dice, GNU
Backgammon will ensure a uniform distribution of the
first roll of the rollout. If 36 trials are requested, one game will
start with 11, two games with 21, two games with 31, etc. In general, if
n * 36 games is requested, n games will start with 11, 2*n games with 21
etc. This is called @emph{rotation} of the first roll.
Similarly, if n*1296 trials is requested, the second roll will be
rotated, such that n games will start with 11-11, n games with 11-21, n
games with 21-21, etc. The third roll be also be rotated if the number
of trials is proportional to 46656.

Suppose a user stops a 1296 trial rollout after 36 games. The 36
games would have had the following rolls for the first two rolls of each
game: 11-11, 21-11, 12-11, 31-11, 13-11, ..., 66-11 Obviously such a
rollout will give skewed results since the second roll was 11 for all
games! To avoid this problem GNU Backgammon
will randomize the sequence of rolls such that it is guaranteed that for
any sample of 36 games you have exactly one game with first roll 11,
exactly one game with second roll 11, etc. This is called
@emph{stratification}.

GNU Backgammon will actually also rotate
and stratify rollouts where the number of trials are not multiples of
36, 1296, etc. The distribution of rolls is obviously not uniform any
longer in this case, but it will still provide some reduction of the
luck, i.e., no 37 trial rollout will have 3 games with a initial 66.

Before the first game of a rollout, GNU
Backgammon creates a pseudo random array which it will use
for all the games in the rollout. In effect it has already decided the
roll sequence it will use for up to 128 rolls in every game of the
rollout. In other words, for a normal rollout where games don't go over
64 moves, every single game of every possible rollout length has already
had its dice sequence determined. During the rollout of game n, sequence
n will be used, for game n+1 sequence n+1, etc. If it's a
@emph{rollout as initial position}, then whenever the
current sequence starts with a double, the sequence is skipped and the
dice routine moves on to the next sequence. Say an @emph{rollout as
initial position} is about to start using sequence 275, but
that sequence begins with a double. The dice routine moves to sequence
276. On the following game, it will use sequence 277 (it remembers how
many it has already skipped).

So, if you select @emph{rollout as initial position}
and 36 games, then you will get a prefect set of rolls for games 1..30
and the first 6 rolls of the next perfect set (the same rolls you would
have gotten for games 31..36 if you'd asked for 1080 games or 10800
games or 92 games or whatever.

The dice sequence doesn't know how many trials it will be asked for,
it simply generates sequences such that for a normal rollout
(@emph{rollout as initial position}) every 36 (30) games
you get all possible 1st rolls, every 1296 (1080) games get every
possible first 2 rolls, every 46656 (38880) games you get full sets of 3
rolls, etc.

@subsection Introduction to evaluation settings

GNU Backgammon evaluation functionality
is driven by 3 separate neural networks. The neural nets evaluates
each position statically, and returns the outcome probabilities of the
game at the given position. However, there are several different
methods and techniques that an evaluation can use, and these can be
adjusted. It's possible to set different levels of lookahead, it's
possible to add noise to the evaluation, and each evaluation can be
done cubeful or cubeless. All these setting together form a total
@emph{evaluation setting}. In GNU
Backgammon there are several of these evaluations
setting for each operation GNU Backgammon
does.

@enumerate 

@item
Evaluation setting for Hints and Evaluations 

@item
Evaluation setting for analysis. 

@item
Evaluation setting for GNU
Backgammon when it's playing. 

@item
Several evaluation settings for each move performed in a
rollout. 
@end enumerate

@node The depth to search and plies, Defining evaluation settings, Introduction to evaluation settings, Evaluation settings
@subsection The depth to search and plies

A @emph{ply} is simply considered to be one turn by
a player. Any position can be evaluated at 0-ply. That means that GNU
Backgammon does not look ahead in the game to evaluate the position.
When GNU Backgammon is evaluating a checker play decision, it looks at
all resulting positions after all the legal moves with the given dice
roll, and evaluates these position at the given ply. It's possible to
set the search depth by specifying the plies lookahead in any
evaluation settings dialog.

Snowie users: GNU Backgammon differs
from some other software, notably Snowie in that GNU
Backgammon zero ply is the same as Snowie 1 ply. In
the same way what is called 2-ply in GNU
Backgammon will therefore be similar to a Snowie 3-ply.

For GNU Backgammon, a 0-ply evaluation
of a move would be done by:

Build a list of all legal moves. For each move, take the resulting
board position and use the neural net to estimate the expected
percentage of wins/gammons/backgammons/losses/gammon losses/backgammon
losses. Rank the moves based on this evaluation.

For one ply, after doing the above step, GNU
Backgammon chooses the best n moves (where n is set by
the move filters). For each one, it takes the resulting position for
that move and goes through all 21 possible dice rolls for the
opponent. From these results, it works out the average expectation for
the initial move and ranks them. This is the same as Snowie 2 ply. You
can think of it as asking "what's my best move if I also consider
every possible dice roll and move my opponent might make?"

For 2 ply (Snowie 3 ply), a similar process is done, but this
time, not only are the opponents possible moves considered, but, for
each of these, the player on roll's next move will be considered as
well.

For a single move, on average there are about 20 legal moves to
consider.

When doing a one ply analysis/evaluation, for the top n moves
(from the move filter, GNU Backgammon needs
to consider 21 rolls by the opponent, 20 and possible legal moves per
roll) = 420 positions to evaluate.

Every additional ply will multiply the previous number of
evaluations by about 400 odd, which explains the huge difference in
playing speed/analysis speed between 0 ply and 2 ply settings. I don't
think many people would enjoy playing against GNU
Backgammon at 3 ply settings, where moves could take
minutes to be selected. It's also not clear that using much deeper
lookahead actually gains a lot in terms of playing strength - if you
really need better answers than 2 ply, rollouts are probably a lot
better.

@node Defining evaluation settings, Playing skill;, The depth to search and plies, Evaluation settings
@subsection Defining evaluation settings

First of all: There are several places in GNU
Backgammon where you can adjust either it's skill at
playing or the quality of it's hints and analysis:

@node Playing skill;, Hints;, Defining evaluation settings, Evaluation settings
@subsection Playing skill:

Settings->Players->Player 0 - choose Supremo or World Class. GNU Backgammon will
take longer choosing its moves, but they will be very strong. At this
setting, it is much stronger than Jellyfish level 7.

@node Hints;, Analysis;, Playing skill;, Evaluation settings
@subsection Hints:

Settings->Evaluation - choose Supremo or World Class if you want hints to be
very accurate, but, like the playing skill setting, you may find that
it can take as long as 15 seconds to get an answer on a 1GHz PC.
Expert will be very fast, but for some positions where you need to
consider what your opponent may do on his roll and how you will follow
it up, the results will be less accurate. A wild guess would be
somewhere around 2 or 3 percent of the time, World Class or stronger
settings would give a different best move and maybe less than 1/2
percent of the time, the Expert result would be seriously
wrong.

@node Analysis;, Rollouts;, Hints;, Evaluation settings
@subsection Analysis:

Settings->Analysis - these settings are used by the Analyze Move/Game/Match
or Session command. Note that this is totally different to what is
used in the Hint command, which uses the above settings. You probably
want at least World Class here. My experience on a 700MHz PC is that a
7 point match takes about 15 to 20 minutes to analyze on the Supremo
settings. But the results tend to be very accurate.

@node Rollouts;, Changing evaluation settings, Analysis;, Evaluation settings
@subsection Rollouts:

Settings->Rollouts->General Settings tick the boxes for 'Cube decisions use same settings
same as checker play' and 'Use same settings for both players'

Settings->Rollouts->First Play Both - select Expert here (this is my opinion). When doing
rollouts, most of the time Expert play will be more than strong enough
if you do say 1296 trials with no truncation. The rollout function has
an enormous number of options, most of which are only useful when
trying to investigate special positions. The simple expert setting for
both players is probably more accurate than any of the Analysis
functions. The downside is that rolling out 1296 trials of an early
move in a game can take a couple of hours. On World Class or Supremo
rollout settings, it can take more than 24 hours of computing
time.

@node Changing evaluation settings, Predefined settings, Rollouts;, Evaluation settings
@subsection Changing evaluation settings

A typical evaluation settings dialog is shown in this figure.

@noindent
@anchor{The evaluation settings dialog}

@strong{The evaluation settings dialog}

[[evalsettings.png]]

The dialog is consisting of two columns, the left column is for
setting the checker play decision evaluation settings, and the right
column is for setting the cube decision evaluation settings.

For each column you can select some predefined settings, or you
can define your own settings.

In the lookahead box, you can adjust the lookahead of each
evaluation by specifying the plies to be evaluated. Each ply costs
approximately a factor of 21 in computational time. Also note that
2-ply is equivalent to Snowie's 3-ply setting.

In the box for Cubeful evaluations, you can specify if you want
GNU Backgammon to evaluate the cube ownership in its evaluations.
With this option turned on it generally improves the evaluation,
specially when it's close to cube decisions, so we recommend that this
option is turned on.

In the Noise box, you can add noise to the evaluation. This can be
smart if you think the program plays to strong. You can use the Noise
box option to introduce noise or errors in the evaluations. This is
useful for introducing levels below 0-ply. The lower rated bots (e.g.,
GGotter) on the GamesGrid backgammon server uses this technique. The
introduced noise can be deterministic, i.e., always the same noise for
the same position, or it can be random.

@node Predefined settings, Move filters, Changing evaluation settings, Evaluation settings
@subsection Predefined settings

At the top of each evaluation settings column, it's possible to
set a predefined setting.

@enumerate 

@item
Beginner This setting uses no lookahead and add up to 0.060
noise to the evaluation. With this setting GNU
Backgammon will evaluate like a beginner.

@item
Casual play This setting uses no lookahead and add up to 0.050
noise to the evaluation. With this setting GNU
Backgammon will evaluate a bit better than the
beginner setting but not much.

@item
Intermediate This setting uses no lookahead and add up to
0.030 noise to each evaluation. It still plays a intermediate
game.

@item
Advanced This setting uses no lookahead and add up to 0.015
noise to each evaluation. This setting plays a good game.

@item
Expert This setting uses no lookahead but does not add any
noise to the evaluations. This settings play a strong game.

@item
World class This setting uses 2-ply lookahead, it uses no
noise and it uses a normal move filter. This plays a really
strong game, on par with the very best humans players.

@item
Supremo This is basically the same as the World Class setting,
but it uses a larger move filter.

@item
Grandmaster This setting uses 3-ply lookahead, no noise and
a large move filter. This setting is extremely strong and still
fast on current computers.

@item
4ply This setting uses 4-ply lookahead, no noise and
a large move filter. This setting is extremely strong, but it's
also quite slow. It is more suitable to analysis than to actual play.

@subsubsection Introduction to move filters

GNU Backgammon uses a technique
called move filters in order to prune the complete list of legal
moves when analyzing checker play decisions.

A move filter for a given ply, say, 2-ply, consists of four
parameters for each sub ply:

@enumerate 

@item
whether to analyze at all at this sub ply, 

@item
the number of moves always accepted at the given level,

@item
the number of extra moves to add, 

@item
the threshold for adding extra moves. 
@end enumerate

A move filter for a given ply, say, 2-ply, consists of four
parameters for each sub ply:

whether to analyze at all at this sub ply, the number of moves
always accepted at the given level, the number of extra moves to
add, the threshold for adding extra moves. For example, for 2-ply
checker play decisions there are two move filters: one for pruning
at 0-ply, and another for pruning at 1-ply. The predefined setting
@emph{Normal} has: accept 0 moves and add up to 8
moves within 0.16 at 0-ply, and no pruning at 1-ply.

Consider the opening position where 4-2 has been rolled:

@noindent
@anchor{Example of move filter settings}

GNU Backgammon starts by finding all

According to the move filter the first 0 moves are accepted. The
equity of the best move is +0.189, and according to the move filter
we add up to 8 extra moves if they're within 0.160, that is, if they
have equity higher than 0.029. Moves 5 through 18 all have equity
lower that, so the move list after pruning at 0-ply consists of
moves 1 through 4. According to the move filter we do not perform
any pruning at 1-ply, so moves 1 through 4 are submitted for
evaluation at 2-ply;

@end multitable


If we instead request a 4-ply checker play decision,
GNU Backgammon will use the move
filters defined for 4-ply:

@multitable @columnfractions 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25
@item
Ply@tab Accept moves@tab Extra moves@tab Threshold for extra moves
@item

@item
1@tab no pruning@tab @tab 
@item
2@tab 0@tab 2@tab 0.040
@item
3@tab no pruning@tab @tab 
@end multitable

The 4-ply move filter is identical to the 2-ply for pruning at
0-ply, so after 0-ply we have the same three moves as above. Since
there is no pruning at 1-ply these three moves are evaluated at
2-ply as above. There is no pruning at 3-ply.

At 4-ply we do not accept any moves, but add up to two moves if
there within 0.040 from the best move. Since the second best move is
-0.138 worse than the best move, we do not accept any moves to be
evaluated at 4-ply. Hence GNU Backgammon
will actually not evaluate any moves on 4-ply.

The predefined move filters all have accept 0 moves, in order to
facilitate fast decisions and analysis, i.e., no need to waste much
time over obvious moves.

For post-mortem analysis it may be worthwhile to ensure that GNU
Backgammon analyzes at least two moves at the specified ply. To do
this, specify accept 2 moves in the move filters you use for
analysis. However, do note that GNU
Backgammon will force evaluation at the specified ply
if the actual move made is doubtful. This ensures that all errors
and blunders are evaluated at the same level.

@node Defining move filters, , Introduction to move filters, Move filters
@subsubsection Defining move filters

The move filter allows you to control exactly how many moves GNU
is examining at each ply. A ply is basically one move played by one
side, thus if both sides played a move, it would be one whole move,
but two plies, one for each side. To change the specific settings,
press the Modify... button.

Although the predefined levels, such as World Class, Supremo,
etc. are tested and good, you may want to know or control how GNU
filters its moves to analyze and how many.

@noindent
@anchor{Move filter 1}

@strong{Move filter 1}

[[movefilter1.png]]

If you are playing Expert level (this is what GGRaccoon is set
at) or another 0-ply setting, the Move Filter settings will not
change a thing, as Expert level automatically examines all moves. At
Supremo level, this changes though, as it takes a selection of the
best moves from 0-ply and examines them at 2-ply. This means that
for those selected moves it will calculate all the possibilities 2
plies ahead and evaluate them, allowing it to find better moves.
Since Supremo is a 2-ply setting, we are only interested in the
2-ply settings of Large as in the figure above. 3-ply or 4-ply
settings will have no effect here because Supremo doesn't examine at
that depth.

In the figure above, we can see it first will Always accept 0
moves. This first line means that it won't force any moves to be
analyzed at 2-ply, it will only analyze moves according to the
second line. If it had said it would always analyze 2 moves, this
would mean that no matter how ridiculously bad the 2nd move was
compared to the 1st, it would analyze both at 2-ply.

The second line says it will Add extra 16 moves within 0.320.
This means that provided they aren't more than 0.320 equity worse
than the top move, it will select a maximum of 16 moves to analyze
at 2-ply. For example, in the figure below, the 2nd best move is no
less than 0.453 equity worse than the top choice, so it didn't
bother analyzing them at 2-ply as it is unlikely to change its mind
on what the best move is.

@noindent
@anchor{Move filter 2}

@strong{Move filter 2}

[[movefilter2.png]]

Take a look at next figure.

@noindent
@anchor{Move filter 3}

@strong{Move filter 3}

[[movefilter3.png]]

Here, the exact same settings were maintained, but the 1-ply
filter was activated. This just means that those 16 moves selected
from the 0-ply are sent instead to be analyzed at 1-ply, and then up
to 5 moves from 1-ply will be sent to be analyzed at 2-ply. So this
would actually be faster than the previous setting (and weaker),
since a maximum of only 5 moves would be analyzed at 2-ply depth.

Tip: Feel free to experiment with the settings, as you can
always reset them by simply choosing one of the predefined levels.
In order to see if they are better, or as good but faster, I'd
suggest comparing the results with Supremo. One setting I have that
works quite well, is to take the basic Supremo setting and in the
Move filter reduce the 16 to 12. It cuts down on the thinking time
by 20-25% more or less, and I haven't seen more than one case in
over 10,000 moves where it missed the best move.

@node Cubeful vs Cubeless, Pruning neural networks, Move filters, Evaluation settings
@subsection Cubeful vs Cubeless

In the evaluation settings dialog box you can specify whether or
not checker play should be evaluated cubeful. It's recommended that
you use cubeful evaluation. To get an understanding of what cubeful
checker play evaluations are, you can take a look at this position:

@noindent
@anchor{Cubeful example}

@strong{Cubeful example}

[[cubeful-ex1.png]]

In this position black has rolled 51 and he has a good position.
If the position is evaluated cubeless the best move is 13/7. Black can
hope white does not roll 34 or 35 form the bar and has now a good
chance to close white out in the next few rolls. However if white
rolls one of the four hitting numbers from the bar, white will quite
soon have a really hot redouble. This redouble increases whites equity
so much that black actually should play this move safe. He should play
13/8 6/5. However if the evaluation was set to cubeless, an setting
which assumes white will never redouble, black should play 13/8.

Here's another example:

@noindent
@anchor{Cubeful example 2}

@strong{Cubeful example 2}

[[cubeful-ex2.png]]

This is from a 5 point match where black has 1 point and white has
3 points. Black wins the opening roll and considers playing 13/11 6/5
or 24/23 13/11.

If GNU Backgammon uses a cubeless
evaluation it will play 24/23 13/11. But if you're using a cubeful
evaluation it will play 13/11 6/5. Slotting with 6/5 is at this score
a better move even though it loses more gammons. The gammons black are
losing won't matter anyway, since black will turn the cube in the next
few rolls anyway. The slotting play also wins more gammons, and with
the cube tuned to 2, black should play towards gammonish positions at
this score.

You can read more about cubeful evaluations in the [[Appendix]].

It's recommended that you use cubeful checker evaluations.

@node Pruning neural networks, Noise, Cubeful vs Cubeless, Evaluation settings
@subsection Pruning neural networks

A feature in the evaluation is the use of a set of neural
networks just to prune away move candidates within a deeper ply
search. This increases the speed considerably and it doesn't lose much
playing strength compared to evaluation without these pruning neural
nets. Jim Segrave has just done an analysis of this and found that
less than 1% of all moves come out different with the pruning nets
activated. In most of these positions the move would not have made any
difference to the game at all.

@node Noise, , Pruning neural networks, Evaluation settings
@subsection Noise

If you think GNU Backgammon plays too
strong for you, you can add some noise to its evaluation. The number
you add into the field in the evaluations setting is the limit amount
of noise that will be added to the evaluation.

If noise is added to the evaluations GNU
Backgammon will take a Box M@"uller transform of a point
in the unit circle and add to each possible outcome probability. This
means that the addition is random, but distributed so that it's more
likely to have an noise addition close to zero than a noise addition
close to the limit. The noise addition is limited to the number you
put into the noise field in the dialog box.

If you check the box Deterministic noise, the noise added to each
evaluation will be based on a sum of the bytes in the hash of the
board position, which (by the central limit theorem) should have a
normal distribution. In that way you will always have that same noise
amount to a position, since the noise added to the evaluation is only
depending on the position itself.

If you want GNU Backgammon to evaluate
and play as strong as possible, you should not add any noise.

@node Appearance, , Evaluation settings, Customizing GNU Backgammon
@section Appearance

You can change the appearance of GNU
Backgammon. There is a lot of options to choose among and
you can have the board look like nearly anything. This section will help
you through some on the appearance customization.

To change the look of the board, you should click Settings->Appearance. This will open a dialog box like this:

@noindent
@anchor{The appearance dialog}

@strong{The appearance dialog}

[[appearance.png]]

In this dialog box you see a preview picture of the board at the
right side, and you have notebook with options to the left.

There are two different board rendering engines in GNU
Backgammon. It's a 2 dimensional rendering engine which
is simple and fast, but still makes really good board images. The moves
can be animated.

The other board rendering type is a 3 dimensional board engine based
on OpenGL. This board rendering engine makes astonishing fine board
graphics, and animates the rolls and moves beautifully. You can even add
textures to your boards and checkers. However, the 3D rendering type
need a good modern graphic card which can take 3D hardware acceleration.

The leftmost tab in the appearance settings notebook is the General
option. You can here select between the 2D board or the 3D board. You
can also choose between different other settings. Most of the settings
here are self explanatory.

@node Generate your own, Download, , Obtaining bearoff databases
@subsection Generate your own

GNU Backgammon is supplied with a
program makebearoff that is used to generate bearoff databases. Due to
various limitations it is only possible to generate bearoff databases
with a size less than 2GB, i.e., the 13pt one-sided database and the
11 checker two-sided database are the largest databases that can be
generated with makebearoff. 

To generate one sided database issue 

makebearoff -o 10 -f gnubg_os.bd

to generate the one sided 10 point database. The program
makebearoff uses a cache to store previously generated positions. You
may set the cache size with the -s size option, e.g., 

makebearoff -o 10 -s 123456789 -f gnubg_os.bd

to use 123,456,789 bytes of memory for cache size. In general, if
the cache size is less than the size of the database to be generated,
then extra time is needed to generate the bearoff database because
some positions may have to be calculated several times. 

makebearoff can also reuse previously generated databases, so if
you already had generated the 9 point database you can reuse it: 

mv gnubg_os.bd gnubg_os9.bd

makebearoff -o 10 -O gnubg_os9.bd -f gnubg_os.bd

Note that makebearoff requires temporary disk space to generate
both one sided and two sided databases. In general, twice the disk
space of the database to be generated is needed. 

To generate a two sided database issue 

makebearoff -t 6x8 -f gnubg_ts.bd

This example will generate the 8 checkers on 6 points database.
Again, it's possible to adjust the amount of memory with the -s
option. It's recommended to set the cache size to the maximum amount
of memory available (although there is no need to set it beyond the
size of the bearoff database to be generated). 

Other options for makebearoff are available, see makebearoff
--help for the complete set. 

The accompanying program makehyper is used to generate databases
for Hypergammon. For example, to generate the 3-checker database issue
the command 

makehyper -c 3 -f hyper3.bd

Since the generation is @emph{very} time consuming
makehyper will generate a checkpoint file (in the example above:
hyper1.bd.tmp) that can be used to restart the calculation if needed
by using the -r option. You can also change the default convergence
threshold of 0.00001 if you're happy with less accurate equities. To
generate the 3 checker database you need approximately 400 MB of free
memory. On a 2.4 GHz box with 512 MB of RAM the calculation ran for 58
iterations of 3000 seconds each, i.e., a total of 48 hours! 

See makehyper --help for the complete set of available options.

@itemize 

@item
@emph{Rockwell-Kazaross} or
@emph{Kazaross-XG2} are the recommended choice.
They were created by rolling out the initial position for every score
up to -15:-15 and are the best currently available estimations

versions of GNU Backgammon,
Snowie or for hand calculations back when
bots didn't do match equity calculations (or there was no bot at all).
All of them are now considered obsolete. Analyses or rollouts using
them can still be found in books, magazines or web sites so it can
occasionally be interesting to use them in
GNU Backgammon
for comparison to these older results.

@item
@emph{jacobs}, @emph{jac050} and

respectively.
They should only be used to analyse such unequal opponents situations.

This is the value of the position in money game, e.g., if your
equity is +0.4 an you are playing money game with a $1 stake, you will
win $0.40 on average. The money equity can be calculated with or
without taking the effect of the doubling cube into consideration, or
@emph{cubeful} or @emph{cubeless}. The
cubeless equity can be calculated from the basic formula:
2*p(w)-1+2(p(wg)-p(lg))+3(p(wbg)-p(lbg)). Evaluating the cubeful
equity is much more difficult; it can either be estimated from the
cubeless equity by using transformations as outlined by Rick Janowski
or by constructing a neural net that directly outputs cubeful
equities. GNU Backgammon uses the former approach (@ref{Cubeful equities}).

@node Match Winning Chance, Normalized equity, Money equity, Equities explained
@subsection Match Winning Chance

In match play we're generally not particular interested in the
outcome of the individual games as much as the outcome of the entire
match, so the interesting quantity for match play is @emph{match
winning chance} (MWC). As for the money equity the MWC can
be calculated with and without the effect of the doubling cube. The MWCs
are generally calculated with the use of a match equity table, which
contains the chance of winning the match before a game starts, e.g.,
if the score is 0-0 in a 1pt match each player has 50% chance of
winning the match before the game starts assuming they're of equal
skill.

The cubeless MWC is calculated as: MWC(cubeless) = p(w) * MWC(w) +
p(l) * MWC(l) + p(wg) * MWC(wg) + p(lg) * MWC(lg) + p(wbg) * MWC(wbg)
* p(lbg) * MWC(lbg).

For example, if the w/g/bg distribution is 0 30 60 - 40 10 0 and
the match score is 1-3 to 5 with the cube on 2 the cubeless MWC is:

MWC(cubeless)= 30% * 50% + 30% * 0% + 30% * 100% + 10% * 0% + 0% *
100% + 0% * 0% = 45%,

so the cubeless MWC is 45%.

Evaluating the cubeful MWC is more difficult, and as for the
cubeful money equity it's possible to estimate cubeful MWCs from
transformation on the w/g/bg distribution or directly calculate it
from neural nets. GNU Backgammon uses the former approach, but the
formula are currently not published.

@node Normalized equity, Cubeful equities, Match Winning Chance, Equities explained
@subsection Normalized equity

It's generally very difficult to compare MWCs. For example, it's
hardly worth mentioning a 0.5% MWC error at DMP where as it's a huge
error at 0-0 to 7. It is therefore of interesting to normalize the
MWCs to some common scale. The most often used normalization is
Normalized Money Game Equity (NEMG) where the MWC for any game is
transformed into the same interval as money game, i.e., -3 to +3 (due
to anomalies at certain match scores the NEMG can go below -3 and
above +3). The transformation is linear:

NEMG = 2 * (MWC-MWC(l))/(MWC(w)-MWC(l)) - 1

In other words, extrapolation with the following two extrapolation
points: (MWC(w),+1) and (MWC(l),-1).

For example, suppose the score is 3-1 to 5 with the cube on 2:
MWC(l)=0% and MWC(w)=50%:

@multitable @columnfractions 0.333333333333333 0.333333333333333 0.333333333333333

@item
50%@tab +1@tab 
@item
75%@tab +2@tab 
@item
100%@tab +3@tab 
@end multitable

Note that a w/g/bg distribution of 0 100 100 - 0 0 0 gives a NEMG
of +3 whereas the corresponding money equity is only +2. This is
because the gammon price is high for that particular score. When both
players are far from winning the match, e.g., 0-0 to 17 or 1-0 to 17,
NEMG is very close to the usual money equity.

NEMG can be calculated from both cubeless and cubeful MWCs.

A word of caution: A cubeless NEMG calculated from a cubeless MWC
could be named @emph{cubeless equity}, but in most
backgammon literature this term seems to be reserved for the cubeless
money equity.

@subsection Cubeful equities

This chapter is a brief description of how GNU
Backgammon calculates cubeful equities. The formula
build directly on the work by Rick Janowski @uref{http://www.bkgm.com/articles/Janowski/cubeformulae.pdf,Take-Points in Money Games} from 1993.

@subsubsection Basic formula for cubeful equities

The basic formula for cubeful equities as derived by Janowski is

E(cubeful) = E(dead) * (1-x) + E(live) * x,

where E(dead) is the dead cube equity (cubeless equity) calculated
from the standard formula. E(live) is the cubeful equity assuming a
fully live cube. We'll return to that in the next section. x is the
cube efficiency. x=0 gives E(cubeful)=E(dead) as one extreme and x=1
gives E(cubeful)=E(live) as the other extreme. In reality x is
somewhere in between, which typical values around 0.6 - 0.8.

Janowski's article doesn't mention cubeful equities, so we use the
straightforward generalization

MWC(cubeful) = MWC(dead) * (1-x) + MWC(live) * x.

as MWC is the entity that is used for match play
evaluations.

@node Live cube equities, 0-ply Cubeful equities, Basic formula for cubeful equities, Cubeful equities
@subsubsection Live cube equities

The live cube equity is the equity assuming that the equity
changes continuously, so that doubles and takes occurs exactly at the
double point and take point. For gammon-free play this is the
well-known take point of 20%. Janowski derives the more general
formula

TP = (L-0.5)/(W+L+0.5)

where W is the average cubeless value of games ultimately won, and
L is the average cubeless value of games ultimately lost. For example,
for the following position

and hence W=(0.454 + 0.103 + 0.001)/0.454=1.229 and
L=(0.556+0.106+0.003)/0.556) = 1.196. For gammon-free positions, e.g.,
a race, W=1 and L=1.

The live cube equity is now based on piecewise linear
interpolation between the points (0%,-L), (TP,-1), (CP,+1), and
(100%,+W): if my winning chance is 0 I lose L points, at my take point
I lose 1 point, at my cash point I cash 1 point, and when I have a
certain win I win W points:

For match play there is no simple formula, since redoubles can
only occur a limited number of times.

The live cube take point is generally calculated as

TP(live, n Cube)=TP(dead, n cube) * (1 - TP(live, 2n cube))

So to calculate the live cube take points for a 1-cube at 3-0 to 7
we need the live cube take points for the 4-cube and the 2-cube. For
the position above and using Woolsey's match equity table the live
cube take point are:

@end multitable

The calculation of these are left as an exercise to the reader.

Ignoring backgammons, the gammon rates for White and Black are
0.106/54.6=19% and 0.103/0.454=22%, respectively. If White wins the
game his MWC will be

81% * MWC(-3,-7) + 19% * MWC(-2,-7) = 78%

and if Black wins his MWC will be

78% * MWC(-4,-6) + 22% * MWC(-4,-5) = 41%.

If White cashes 1 point he has MWC(-3,-7)=76% and if Black cashes
he has MWC(-4,-6)=36%. Analogous to money game the live cube MWC is
calculated as piecewise linear interpolation between (0%,22%),
(24.5%,24%), (72.7%,36%), and (100%,41%) (from black's point of view):

@subsubsection 0-ply Cubeful equities

Having established the live cube equities and MWCs we're now in
position to calculate the 0-ply cubeful equities.

Let's start with money game: the cubeless equity is -0.097 and the
live cube equity can be determined from the figure above as -0.157.
Thus, the cubeful equity is -0.138.

For the match play example at the score 3-0 the cubeless MWC is
29.1% and from the figure Black using wins=45.4% we can determine the
live cube MWC to be 29.2%. Using a value of x=0.68 we arrive at a
cubeful MWC of 29.17%.

@node n-ply Cubeful equities, The cube efficiency, 0-ply Cubeful equities, Cubeful equities
@subsubsection n-ply Cubeful equities

The previous section concerned the calculation of 0-ply cubeful
equities, so how so GNU Backgammon
calculate cubeful 2-ply equities? The answer is: by simple recursion:

Equity=0

Loop over 21 dice rolls

Find best move for given roll

Equity = Equity + Evaluate n-1 ply equity for resulting position

End Loop

Equity = Equity/36

Note that evaluating the n-1 ply equity involves a cube decision,
since the opponent may double, so GNU
Backgammon will actually calculate the two n-1 ply
equities: (a) assuming no double, and (b) assuming double, take. These
two equities are combined with the equity for a pass, and the optimum
of these three is added to the resulting equity. For a cubeful 2-ply
evaluation GNU Backgammon will end up
calculating the following cubeful 0-ply equities: centered 1-cube,
opponent owns 2-cube, owned 4-cube, and opponent owns 8-cube.

Note that the 2-ply level does not use the cube efficiency, it's
not used until at the 0-ply level, but it's possible to calculate an
effective one by isolating x in the basic cube formula:

x(eff) = (E(2-ply cubeful) - E(2-ply dead))/(E(2-ply live)-E(2-ply
dead)).

@node The cube efficiency, Cube decisions, n-ply Cubeful equities, Cubeful equities
@subsubsection The cube efficiency

The cube efficiency is obviously an important parameter,
unfortunately there haven't been much investigation carried out, so
GNU Backgammon basically uses the values
0.6-0.7 originally suggested by Rick Janowski:

@multitable @columnfractions 0.5 0.5
@item
Position Class @tab x (Cube efficiency)
@item
Two-sided (exact) bearoff@tab n/a
@item
One-sided bearoff@tab 0.6
@item
Crashed@tab 0.68
@item
Contact@tab 0.68
@item
Race@tab linear interpolation between 0.6 and 0.7
@end multitable

For race GNU Backgammon uses linear
interpolation based on pip count for the player on roll. A pip count
of 40 gives x=0.6 and 120 gives x=0.7. If the pip count is below 40 or
above 120 values of x=0.6 and x=0.7 are used, respectively.

For the two sided bearoff positions the cubeful money equity is
already available from the database, so for money game there is no
need to calculate cubeful equities via Janowski's formula. However,
the cubeful equities for money game cannot be used for match play.
Instead of using a fixed value of x, say, 0.6, GNU
Backgammon will calculate an effective value based on
the cubeful money equity. The cubeful MWC is calculated as usual, but
with the calculated x.

There is obviously room for improvements. For example, holding
games should intuitively have a lower cube efficiency, since it's very
difficult to double effectively: either it's not good enough or you've
lost the market by a mile after rolling a high double or hitting a
single shot. Similarly, backgames will often have a low cube
efficiency, whereas blitzes have may have a higher cube
efficiency.

@node Cube decisions, Beyond the simple model, The cube efficiency, Cubeful equities
@subsubsection Cube decisions

GNU Backgammon's cube decisions are
simple based on calculations of cubeful equities. For a double
decision GNU Backgammon calculates the
cubeful equity for @emph{no double} and the cubeful
equity for @emph{double, take}. Combined with the equity
for @emph{double, pass}, it's possible to determine the
correct cube action.

The figure below shows the relevant cubeful equities for White and
black's cube decisions in sample position from earlier.

@end example

On 0-ply Black will double when the green curve (White owns
2-cube) is above the red curve (centered cube), and White will take as
long as the green curve is below 1. Similarly, White will double when
the blue curve (Black owns 2-cube) is below the red curve (centered
cube), and Black takes as long as the blue curve is above -1.

Note that GNU Backgammon doesn't
calculate the take point or double point explicitly. The cube decision
is simply made by comparing equities from the figure.

@node Beyond the simple model, , Cube decisions, Cubeful equities
@subsubsection Beyond the simple model

Janowski has developed two other models for cubeful equities. The
first is a generalization of the one used by GNU
Backgammon; it introduces two cube efficiencies
instead of one. Often you may see that the cube efficiencies are
different for the two players, and the @emph{refined general
model} as it is named by Janowski, tries to take this into
consideration by using different cube efficiency parameters for the
two players. For example, the blitzer may have another cube efficiency
that the blitzee.

The second model is not published, but redefines the cube
efficiency into a value that can be understood more intuitively and
calculate easily from rollouts.

@node A technical description of the Position ID, A technical description of the Match ID, Equities explained, Technical Notes
@section A technical description of the Position ID

This section describes a method for compactly recording a
backgammon position. It demonstrates how to encode a position into
10 binary bytes, which is useful for minimizing the space used when
recording large numbers of positions in memory or on disk. There is
also an ASCII representation in 14 characters, which is convenient
for output to the screen, for copying and pasting to transfer
positions between programs which support the format, and for
communicating positions via Usenet news or e-mail. The 10 byte
binary format is called the key, and the 14 character ASCII format
is the ID.

The key is essentially a bit string (imagine you start with an
empty sequence of bits, and continue adding either
@emph{0} or @emph{1} to the end). The
way to build up a sequence that corresponds to a given position is:

@enumerate 

@item
For every point around the board (starting at the ace point
of the player on roll, continuing around to the 24 point and
ending at the bar): 

@item
append as many 1s as the player on roll has on that point
(if any). 

@item
append a 0. 

@item
For every point around the board (starting at the ace point
of the opponent, continuing around to the opponent's 24 point
and ending at the bar): 

@item
append as many 1s as the opponent has on that point (if
any). 

@item
append a 0. 

@item
Pad out the string to 80 bits with 0s. 
@end enumerate

The worst-case representation will require 80 bits: you can see
that there are always 50 0 bits even if there are no checkers at
all. Each player has a maximum of 15 checkers in play (not yet borne
off) which require a 1 bit wherever they are positioned. That's 30
bits to take of all checkers, plus the 50 bits of overhead for a
total of 80 bits (the last bit is always 0 and isn't strictly
necessary, but it makes the code slightly easier). This bit string
should be stored in little-endian order when packed into bytes (i.e.
the first bits in the string are stored in the least significant
bits of the first byte).

As an example, here's what the starting position looks like in
the key format:

@multitable @columnfractions 0.5 0.5
@item
0 0 0 0 0@tab player on roll has no checkers on ace to 5 points
@item
11111 0@tab 5 checkers on the 6 point
@item
0@tab empty bar
@item
111 0@tab 3 on the 8
@item
0 0 0 0@tab no others in our outfield
@item
11111 0@tab 5 on the midpoint
@item
0 0 0 0 0@tab none in the opponent's outfield
@item
0 0 0 0 0@tab or in opponent's board, until...
@item
11 0@tab two on the 24 point
@item
0@tab none on the bar
@item
0 0 0 0 0@tab opponent has no checkers on ace to 5 points
@item
11111 0@tab 5 checkers on the 6 point
@item
0@tab empty bar
@item
111 0@tab 3 on the 8
@item
0 0 0 0@tab no others in opponent's outfield
@item
11111 0@tab 5 on the midpoint
@item
0 0 0 0 0@tab none in our outfield
@item
0 0 0 0 0@tab or in our board, until...
@item
11 0@tab two on the 24 point
@item
0@tab none on the bar
@end multitable

so altogether it's:

00000111110011100000111110000000000011000000011111001110000011111000000000001100

In little endian bytes it looks like:

@multitable @columnfractions 0.166666666666667 0.166666666666667 0.166666666666667 0.166666666666667 0.166666666666667 0.166666666666667
@item
11100000@tab 01110011@tab 11110000@tab 00000001@tab 00110000@tab 1110000001110011111100000000000100110000
@item
0xE0@tab 0x73@tab 0xF0@tab 0x01@tab 0x30@tab 0xE00x730xF00x010x30
@end multitable

so the 10 byte key (in hex) is E0 73 F0 01 30 E0 73 F0 01
30.

The ID format is simply the @uref{http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2045.txt,Base64} encoding
of the key. (Technically, a Base64 encoding of 80 binary bits should
consist of 14 characters followed by two = padding characters, but
this padding is omitted in the ID format.)

To continue the above example, splitting the 10 8-bit bytes into
14 6-bit groups gives:

111000 000111 001111 110000 000000 010011 000011 100000 011100
111111 000000 000001 001100 000000

In Base64 encoding, these groups are respectively represented
as:

4 H P w A T D g c / A B M A

So, the position ID of the checkers at the start of the game is
simply:

4HPwATDgc/ABMA

You can set the board in gnubg either by writing the position ID
into the position text input field in the GUI or by executing the
command

set board 4HPwATDgc/ABMA.

@emph{Notes}

@enumerate 

@item
This encoding is obviously not as compact as it could be: in
particular, there are lots of redundant representations of
illegal positions where both players have checkers on the same
point. Theoretically, it would be possible to get it down to 64
bits by using @uref{http://www.bkgm.com/rgb/rgb.cgi?view+371,Walter Trice's }
@uref{http://www.bkgm.com/rgb/rgb.cgi?view+371,@emph{D() expressions}}, but I think you'd have to be a mathematical masochist
to try it! 

@item
Thanks to Tom Keith and David desJardins for their
suggestions on simplifying the encoding without increasing the
worst case length. 
@end enumerate

@node A technical description of the Match ID, Description of the CSS style sheet, A technical description of the Position ID, Technical Notes
@section A technical description of the Match ID

This section describes how the match ID is calculated. The match
ID can be used for easy exchange of positions for gnubg users in
conjunction with the position ID. The match key is a 9 byte
representation of the match score, match length, value of cube, owner
of cube, Crawford game flag, player on roll, player to make a
decision, doubled flag, resigned flag, and the dice rolled. The match
ID is the 12 character Base64 encoding of the match key. Match key

The match key is a bit string of length 66:

@multitable @columnfractions 0.125 0.125 0.125 0.125 0.125 0.125 0.125 0.125
@item
1-4@tab 5-6@tab 7@tab 8@tab 9-11@tab 12@tab 13@tab 14-1516-1819-2122-3637-5152
@item
Cube@tab CubeOwner@tab DiceOwner@tab Crawford@tab GameState@tab TurnOwner@tab Double@tab ResignDice1Dice2MatchLen x 15 Score1 x 15Score2 x 15
@end multitable

@enumerate 

@item
Bit 1-4 contains the 2-logarithm of the cube value. For
example, a 8-cube is encoded as 0011 binary (or 3), since 2 to the
power of 3 is 8. The maximum value of the cube in with this
encoding is 2 to the power of 15, i.e., a 32768-cube. 

@item
Bit 5-6 contains the cube owner. 00 if player 0 owns the cube,
01 if player 1 owns the cube, or 11 for a centered cube. 

@item
Bit 7 is the player on roll or the player who did roll (0 and
1 for player 0 and 1, respectively). 

@item
Bit 8 is the Crawford flag: 1 if this game is the Crawford
game, 0 otherwise. 

@item
Bit 9-11 is the game state: 000 for no game started, 001 for
playing a game, 010 if the game is over, 011 if the game was
resigned, or 100 if the game was ended by dropping a cube. 

@item
Bit 12 indicates whose turn it is. For example, suppose player
0 is on roll then bit 7 above will be 0. Player 0 now decides to
double, this will make bit 12 equal to 1, since it is now player
1's turn to decide whether she takes or passes the cube. 

@item
Bit 13 indicates whether an doubled is being offered. 0 if no
double is being offered and 1 if a double is being offered.

@item
Bit 14-15 indicates whether an resignation was offered. 00 for
no resignation, 01 for resign of a single game, 10 for resign of a
gammon, or 11 for resign of a backgammon. The player offering the
resignation is the inverse of bit 12, e.g., if player 0 resigns a
gammon then bit 12 will be 1 (as it is now player 1 now has to
decide whether to accept or reject the resignation) and bit 13-14
will be 10 for resign of a gammon. 

@item
Bit 16-18 and bit 19-21 is the first and second die,
respectively. 0 if the dice has not yet be rolled, otherwise the
binary encoding of the dice, e.g., if 5-2 was rolled bit 16-21
will be 101-010. 

@item
Bit 22 to 36 is the match length. The maximum value for the
match length is 32767. A match score of zero indicates that the
game is a money game. 

@item
Bit 37-51 and bit 52-66 is the score for player 0 and player 1
respectively. The maximum value of the match score is 32767.
@end enumerate

For example, assume the score is 2-4 in a 9 point match with
player 0 holding a 2-cube, and player 1 has just rolled 52. The match
key for this will be (note that the bit order is reversed below for
readability)

1000 00 1 0 100 1 0 00 101 010 100100000000000 010000000000000
001000000000000

In little endian the bytes looks like:

01000001 10001001 00101010 00000001 00100000 00000000 00100000
00000000 00

0x41 0x89 0x2A 0x01 0x20 0x00 0x20 0x00 0x00

Analogous to the position ID from the previous section the match
ID format is simply the Base64 encoding of the key.

To continue the example above, the 9 8-bit bytes are grouped into
12 6-bits groups:

010000 011000 100100 101010 000000 010010 000000 000000 001000
000000 000000 000000

In Base64 encoding, the groups are represented as:

Q Y k q A S A A I A A A

So, the match id is simply:

QYkqASAAIAAA

If someone post a match ID you can set up the position in gnubg by
writing or pasting it into the Match ID text input field on the main
window, or by executing the command

set matchid QYkqASAAIAAA.

@node Description of the CSS style sheet, , A technical description of the Match ID, Technical Notes
@section Description of the CSS style sheet

As mentioned above GNU Backgammon
writes a CSS style sheet along with the generated XHTML file. The CSS
style sheet may be written verbatim in the header section of the XHTML
file, to an external file named gnubg.css, or inside the tags using
the style attribute. If you wish to make any modifications to the
style sheet without modifying the actual source code of
GNU Backgammon you have to choose one of
the first two methods. Note that the special export for Kit Woolsey's
GammOnLine uses the third method since the XHTML is pasted into a web
page without the possibility to modify the header section of the page
where the style sheet is defined. Thus, it's not possible to modify
the style of the generated XHTML for GammOnLine without modifications
of the source code or extensive search and replace in the generated
XHTML.

@node What is GNU Backgammon?, What operating systems are supported?, , General questions
@subsection What is GNU Backgammon?

GNU Backgammon (gnubg) is a program for
playing and analyzing backgammon positions, games and matches. It's
based on a neural network. You may play GNU
Backgammon using the command line or a graphical
interface based on GTK+.

@node What operating systems are supported?, Where do I get it?, What is GNU Backgammon?, General questions
@subsection What operating systems are supported?

GNU Backgammon is mostly developped
on @emph{GNU/Linux}. It also builds and runs under
other Unix operating systems like those derived from
@emph{BSD} or
@emph{Solaris}. The main prerequisite is the
availability of the GLib library at version 2.6 or later.

Installable packages for
@emph{MS Windows} and @emph{Mac OS X} are
available for download at the project official website. Already
built packages are often provided by Linux distributions as well.

When you successfully port
GNU Backgammon to other operating systems, you are welcome to give us
a note at @uref{mailto:bug-gnubg@@gnu.org,the GNU backgammon  mailing list.}

@node On what CPU will GNU Backgammon run fastest?, , It does not compile, How to install
@subsection On what CPU will GNU Backgammon run  fastest?

GNU Backgammon's speed depends on the
CPU only. It doesn't need much memory (any machine not totally obsolete
will have enough) and does little or no I/O (a fast disk or a SSD won't make any difference).

The table below lists CPUs and the result of the command Analyze->Evaluation Speed, showing the relative speed of various processors.
Note that these numbers are not directly comparable with those given by the similar command from eXtreme Gammon.

Well, your computer wants to communicate with you. Give it a
chance and read (and try to understand) what it is telling you. Then
read the next items carefully:

@node GNU Backgammon complains about missing files, Starting from the WinXP menu it plays like a beginner, I get an error message when starting, Running GNU Backgammon
@subsection GNU Backgammon complains about missing  files

GNU Backgammon reads several different
files at start-up. It will first try to read a file called gnubg.wd.
This is a file which contains all the neural net weights and is
necessary for the program to evaluate positions. If this file is not
found, or found corrupted or with an incompatible version,
GNU Backgammon will search for a weights
file called gnubg.weights. This file also contains the neural net
weights, but is stored in ASCII format. If none of these files are
found, GNU Backgammon will start, but it
will give you a warning about these missing files, and it will play
@emph{very} poorly.

GNU Backgammon will also read the
bearoff databases at start-up. There are usually two bearoff
databases. The first is called gnubg_os0.bd, and has stored data about
the bearoff probabilities of all position where both players have 15
or fewer checkers left on their six home board points. If this file is
not found, GNU Backgammon will create a
heuristic bearoff database for these positions. This database is a
also called the 'One Sided Database', since it evaluates each player
separately. The other bearoff database is called gnubg_ts0.bd. This
bearoff database contains win probabilities for all bearoff positions
with six or less checkers. It also contains cubeful equities (Money
Game) for all the positions. If this file is not found at start-up,
GNU Backgammon will evaluate late bearoff
positions with the one sided bearoff database.

@subsection What is the difference of a new game or match or session?

When you start a new match, you will be asked to play to a certain
amount of points (for example, 7 points). The player who firstly
reaches this amount wins the match. Starting a new session means
playing to an infinite amount. Be aware that the rules do slightly
differ, mainly the Jacoby rule is applies to sessions and the Crawford
to match play.

@node What is a beaver in Backgammon?, How do I move the checkers?, What is the difference of a new game or match or session?, Playing backgammon
@subsection What is a beaver in Backgammon?

A beaver is only allowed in a money game session. To beaver means
to redouble, retaining control of the cube, immediately after your
opponent doubles. For more information see the @uref{http://www.bkgm.com/glossary.html#B,glossary at Backgammon  Galore}.

@node How do I move the checkers?, Why am I allowed to place more than 5 checkers on a point?, What is a beaver in Backgammon?, Playing backgammon
@subsection How do I move the checkers?

The easiest way to move checkers is to "@emph{drag and
drop}." Put your mouse pointer over a checker you want to
move, press the left mouse button and drag the checker to the desired
point, holding down the button while dragging.

If you prefer to use mouse clicks, the left mouse button is for
the left die shown on your board. Right click your mouse for the right
die.

If you always want the higher number displayed on the left, go to
the menu Settings->Appearance-> General  and select Show higher die on left.

@node Why am I allowed to place more than 5 checkers on a point?, GNU Backgammon plays poorly, How do I move the checkers?, Playing backgammon
@subsection Why am I allowed to place more than 5 checkers on a point?

The official backgammon tournament rules allow to put
up to all 15 checkers on a point. Playing with a maximum of 5
checkers, sometimes known as the Egyptian Rule, is no longer
supported by
GNU Backgammon.

@node GNU Backgammon plays poorly, GNU Backgammon is too strong for me, Why am I allowed to place more than 5 checkers on a point?, Playing backgammon
@subsection GNU Backgammon plays poorly

Are you sure? If the answer is yes you should think about going to
Monte Carlo this summer and win the Backgammon World Championship. If
this plan fails, check whether the weights file is loaded at start-up.

@subsection What are Plies?

A ply describes how far GNU Backgammon
evaluates the position. @emph{0-ply} means that
GNU Backgammon estimates the worth of the
position as it is. A @emph{1-ply} evaluation looks one
step deeper, i.e. it evaluates the position after making the best
possible move for each of the 21 different rolls and returns the
averaged result. @emph{2-ply} is another roll further
and so on.

The more plies you choose, the more you strengthen
GNU Backgammon. Keep in mind that this
will also decrease the playing speed.

Note also that @emph{0-ply} in GNU
Backgammon is equivalent to the
@emph{1-ply} evaluation of Snowie.

It's possible that Snowie's is a @emph{playing} ply
while gnubg's is a @emph{position evaluation} ply. When
playing at 1-ply Snowie will make each possible move for the player's
roll (that's 1 ply) and analyze the resulting positions. Playing at
2-ply it will take each of those positions and make all the opponent
moves for all possible rolls (the 2nd ply) and then analyze the
resulting positions. In GNU Backgammon the
initial set of possible moves is taken for granted, i.e. not counted
as a ply, because gnubg's plies are position evaluation plies. Thus,
for each of those possible moves a 0-ply analysis is done. gnubg's
discounting of the first set of moves perhaps makes the counting seem
funny.

Looking at it a different way, if you give GNU
Backgammon a position and analyze it at 1-ply, it will
make all the moves for all possible rolls (the 1st ply) and then
analyze the resulting positions. With Snowie it will assume that the
position arose from a move (that's a pretend 1st ply) then make all
the moves for all possible rolls (the 2nd ply) and analyze them. This
time it's Snowie that seems to be counting strangely.

@node What is noise?, , What are Plies?, Settings
@subsection What is noise?

Noise is a facility for disturbing GNU
Backgammon's 0-ply evaluation. Raising the noise level
decreases its playing strength.

You will find a small window titled `GNUbg ID'
at the bottom of the GNU Backgammon window.
It contains an short, textual, representation of the position at hand,
suitable for easily copying and pasting positions.

It is composed of a `Position ID' describing the checkers position and a `Match ID' for the other features (match score, cube position and value, dice, who is on roll...).
A detailed description of both formats is found earlier in @ref{A technical description of the Position ID}.

Pasting a `XGID' (a similar shortcut used by eXtreme Gammon) there is recognized as well.

@node How do I set up a position manually?, Which formats can I use to import matches and positions?, What are these funny letters at the right bottom?, Analyzing
@subsection How do I set up a position manually?

Open a new game, match or session. If gnubg already rolls the
dice, don't bother. Press `edit', and either type the position_id and
press Enter on your keyboard, or use the mouse to set up the checkers.

A mouse click at the border of the board empties the point. A left
or right click sets up a certain amount of checkers depending on where
exactly on the pip you click. Set up the cube with a right mouse click
on it.

You can also drag and drop checkers when holding down the Ctrl
key.

Finally, go to the menu and select `Game, Set turn' to choose the
player on roll. The dice will then disappear.

@node What does Pips mean?, What does EPC mean?, How is the error rate determined?, Analyzing
@subsection What does Pips mean?

The pip count is a measurement showing the total number of pips
required for a player to bear off all checkers from the current
position. It can be regarded as a rough estimate of the
@emph{raceness} of the position. A player with a
lower pip count may in many situations want to try to race, whilst the
opponent (with the higher pip count) may want to try blocking/holding.
See also the @uref{http://www.bkgm.com/gloss/lookup.cgi?pip+count,explanation on  BackGammon Galore}.

(For the non-english speaking community it might be helpful to
know that when you roll a six and a five, the total pips of that roll
is eleven.)

@node What does EPC mean?, , What does Pips mean?, Analyzing
@subsection What does EPC mean?

When bearing off checkers, you may notice a display showing the
current @emph{EPC} value (next to the display of
@emph{Pips}). The EPC display can be turned on or off
under menu @emph{Settings -> Options ->
Display}.

@emph{EPC} stands for Effective Pip Count, and is an
alternative measurement of the @emph{goodness} of the
position. The usual pip count can be a misleading
@emph{goodness} estimate when both players are bearing
off. What is more important (for making cubing decisions) is
@emph{the expected number of rolls} each player needs
to bear off hes checkers.

The effective pip count is defined as this expected number of
remaining rolls, multiplied with the average number of pips in a roll,
which is 8.167. (The average number of pips in a roll would be 7 if
rolling a double wouldn't yield a double pip count. A double-6
yields 24 pips, not 12.)

Thus, EPC takes into account not only the current pip count, but
also the expected pip wastage:

@enumerate 

@item
Effective Pip Count (EPC) = pip count + expected pip wastage
@end enumerate

An example:

@enumerate 

@item
Position: 5 checkers on the 1-point, 4 checkers on the
2-point. 

@item
Pip count: 5x1 + 4x2 = 13 

@item
EPC: 2.189 (expected number of remaining rolls) * 8.167 =
17.878 

@item
Wasted: 17.878 - 13 = 4.878 
@end enumerate

It's clear (hopefully) that the expected pip wastage (and hence
the @emph{EPC}) increases with more checkers on lower
points (e.g. you get pip wastage when rolling a 6 to bear off a
checker from the 2- or 1-point).

It is further @uref{http://www.bkgm.com/gloss/lookup.cgi?effective+pip+count,explained on BackGammon Galore}, especially in a @uref{http://www.bkgm.com/rgb/rgb.cgi?view+1076,post by Douglas  Zare}.

How do one calculate the EPC then, or the expected number of
remaining rolls? GnuBG uses the one-sided bearoff database, which
contains the chance of bearing off the final checker in any given
number of rolls. A player would probably use some quite complicated
heuristics (please see the aforementioned post by Douglas Zare,
@emph{and do get back here and explain it!})

@subsection CP?

Cash-point(CP) is
your opponent's take-point now seen from your side of the
board (your cash-point which equals 100% minus your opponent's
take-point). GNU Backgammon
uses the term @emph{missed double below cash-point},
which means that the player should have doubled, and had he done so,
his opponent should take. @emph{Missed double above CP}
in a similar way means that the correct cube-action was double pass.

If you are the leader in the match, the relevant take- and
double-points will often look something like this (where TP*=CP):

@noindent
@anchor{The double line}

for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is
published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for
works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
@unnumberedsubsec   1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS  

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be

copyright law.

A ``Modified Version'' of the Document means any work containing
the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A ``Secondary Section'' is a named appendix or a front-matter
section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of
the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection
with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

The ``Invariant Sections'' are certain Secondary Sections whose
titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section
does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to
be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant
Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then
there are none.

The ``Cover Texts'' are certain short passages of text that are
listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says
that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A ``Transparent'' copy of the Document means a machine-readable
copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is
not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is
not ``Transparent'' is called ``Opaque''.

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML
using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent
image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary
formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors,
SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by
some word processors for output purposes only.

The ``Title Page'' means, for a printed book, the title page
itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, ``Title Page''
means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's
title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

The ``publisher'' means any person or entity that distributes
copies of the Document to the public.

A section ``Entitled XYZ'' means a named subunit of the Document
whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands
for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
``Acknowledgements'', ``Dedications'',
``Endorsements'', or ``History''.) To ``Preserve
the Title'' of such a section when you modify the Document means that
it remains a section ``Entitled XYZ'' according to this
definition.

@unnumberedsubsec   2. VERBATIM COPYING  

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright
notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the
Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical
measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the
copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in
exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you
must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you
may publicly display copies.
@unnumberedsubsec   3. COPYING IN QUANTITY  

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the
back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title
with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to
the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy
these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the
actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy
along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
computer-network location from which the general network-using public has
access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the
latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent
copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
@unnumberedsubsec   4. MODIFICATIONS  

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the
Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version
filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and
modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In
addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

@enumerate 

@item
Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which
should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the
Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the
original publisher of that version gives permission.

@item
List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

@item
State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified
Version, as the publisher.

@item
Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

@item
Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to
the other copyright notices.

@item
Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

@item
Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license
notice.

@item
Include an unaltered copy of this License.

@item
Preserve the section Entitled ``History'', Preserve its
Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title
Page. If there is no section Entitled ``History'' in the
Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher
of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item
describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.

@item
Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the
network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was
based on.  These may be placed in the ``History''
section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published
at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

@item
For any section Entitled ``Acknowledgements'' or
``Dedications'', Preserve the Title of the section, and
preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the
contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

@item
Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in
their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are
not considered part of the section titles.

@item
Delete any section Entitled ``Endorsements''. Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

@item
Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
``Endorsements'' or to conflict in title with any Invariant
Section.

@item
Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
@end enumerate

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections
as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant
Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles
must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled ``Endorsements'', provided it
contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties --- for example, statements of peer review or that the text
has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of
Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text
and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made
by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the
same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same
entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher
that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
endorsement of any Modified Version.
@unnumberedsubsec   5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS  

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections
of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as
Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that
you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there
are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents,
make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in
parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section
if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section
titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
``History'' in the various original documents, forming one
section Entitled ``History''; likewise combine any sections
Entitled ``Acknowledgements'', and any sections Entitled
``Dedications''. You must delete all sections Entitled
``Endorsements''.
@unnumberedsubsec   6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS  

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other
respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
@unnumberedsubsec   7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS  

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an ``aggregate'' if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of
the compilation's users beyond what the individual works
permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does
not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies
of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire
aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that
bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of
covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear
on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.
@unnumberedsubsec   8. TRANSLATION  

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing
Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from
their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all
Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant
Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the
license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided
that you also include the original English version of this License and the
original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a
disagreement between the translation and the original version of this
License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled ``Acknowledgements'',
``Dedications'', or ``History'', the requirement
(section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require
changing the actual title.
@unnumberedsubsec   9. TERMINATION  

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as
expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically
terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless
and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your
license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you
of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the
cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of
violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and
you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this
License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not
give you any rights to use it.
@unnumberedsubsec   10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE  

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU
Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns. See
@uref{http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/,Copyleft}.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If
the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License
``or any later version'' applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of
any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free
Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft)
by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy
can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.
@unnumberedsubsec   11. RELICENSING  

``Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site'' (or ``MMC
Site'') means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable
works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those
works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a
server. A ``Massive Multiauthor Collaboration'' (or
``MMC'') contained in the site means any set of copyrightable
works thus published on the MMC site.

``CC-BY-SA'' means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike
3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published
by that same organization.

``Incorporate'' means to publish or republish a Document, in
whole or in part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is ``eligible for relicensing'' if it is licensed under
this License, and if all works that were first published under this
License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in
whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant
sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.
@unnumberedsubsec   ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents  

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the
License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

@example
Copyright @copyright{} YEAR YOUR NAME

Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the
terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no
Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in
the section entitled ``GNU Free Documentation License''.
@end example

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the ``with@dots{} Texts.'' line with this:

@example
with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts
being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
@end example

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their
use in free software.

@bye
