The impact these programs have had on the way the game is understood and played cannot be overstated. Players of all levels have the option of purchasing these revolutionary <span class="emphasis"><em>bots</em></span> (short for robots) in order to not only have the pleasure of getting a drubbing by a world-class opponent as many times as they want, but also have it analyze their moves, games, and matches. The program will point out our mistakes, tell us how big a blunder our move was, and list the best moves. It is still up to us to understand why our move or cube action was wrong, however there is no question such a tool is priceless. </p><p>Perhaps <span class="emphasis"><em>priceless</em></span> is a poor choice of words as the price is by no means a given. Though the programs come with different options depending on how much one is willing to spend, a version with all the trimmings, such as importing one's matches, analyzing the games, grading your play, allowing rollouts, etc. will set you back no less than $380 for Snowie or <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> $220 for the older, and less sophisticated Jellyfish. This would seem to indicate that a top-quality aide is only in reach of someone with deep pockets or a deep commitment. If not, one has to look at some of the free offerings available on the Internet.</p><p>Personally, when I first heard of GNU Backgammon, I immediately remembered with a grimace my first experience with an old version of GNU Chess several years earlier: an engine that barely played at an expert level, as opposed to other master-level programs, an absolute bare minimum in functions, and graphics that reminded me of my first Atari video game system from back in 1977. The surprise that awaited me couldn't have been greater.</p><p>GNU Backgammon is first of all a neural-net program of World-Class strength. It is based on the same technology from which Jellyfish and Snowie originated. </p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>
              <p>Neural Net technology</p>
              <p>The concept of neural-net technology is what permitted the breakthrough in playing levels from <span class="emphasis"><em>interesting amateur</em></span> to <span class="emphasis"><em>world-class</em></span> playing literally on par with the best in the world. The person behind this <a class="ulink" href="http://researchweb.watson.ibm.com/massive/tdl.html" target="_top">brilliant idea</a> is Gerald Tesauro, a researcher for IBM, who built the first neural-net program called TD-Gammon. The difference it brought was that instead of simply using weights and strategies of programmers and players, it created its own by playing against itself hundreds of thousands of times, with each version stronger than the previous one. By version 2.1, which had played 1.5 million games, two-time World Champion Bill Robertie declared it as good as a strong master and even wrote a book on the experience called <a class="ulink" href="http://bkgm.com/books/Robertie-LearningFromTheMachine.html" target="_top">Learning from the Machine</a>. In fact, because of its independent learning, its play and that of subsequent programs using neural-net technology have revealed revolutionary strategic knowledge of the game from which top modern practice is based. GNU Backgammon is among those neural-net giants, and is among the top programs in the world.</p>

Although GNU won with a convincing 56-44, subsequent analysis, taking into account the luck factor, revealed that they were of exactly the same strength. GNU 0.14 is 1.18% stronger at 0-ply (the setting of GGRaccoon) than GNU 0.13 at 0-ply in money games.</p><p>GNU is made of 3 neural nets: the contact net which is the main net for middlegame positions, the crashed net, and the race net which is so that GNU does not suffer from the common bane of backgammon programs: the non-contact bearin. For more information on how the neural nets were developed, see Joseph Heled's (the developer) site <a class="ulink" href="http://pages.quicksilver.net.nz/pepe/ngb/index.html" target="_top">The GNU Backgammon Training Program</a>.

Start a game by clicking on the New button. In the window, select Human vs. Human. Select Manual dice if you want to enter the dice played, and not have GNU roll them.</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/38371a4c.png" align="middle" /></div><p>If you want to change the direction of the play (ex: left to right), just click on the Reverse Direction <img src="images/1540d81e.png" /> button.

If you make a mistake and enter the wrong dice, just go to the Game menu again and select Set dice.</p><p>If you make a mistake in the move played, and want to correct this, go to the Game Record (the move list), click on the move you want to change,</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/78be1dd5.png" align="middle" /></div><p>replay it, and continue from there. It will automatically erase the moves after.

This opens a window displaying the settings for GNU or allowing you to play against someone else (or even have GNU play against itself). At the top there is a tab where you can also set your name for the player. For the GNU engine, I prefer the pre-defined setting of Supremo or World Class for both checker play and cube decisions. At this setting it will take some time to play at given moments which may not be to the taste of everyone, so if you want a top-notch game, just a fraction worse, but almost instant, select Expert instead. You may also get tired of getting beat up by it (if you think it cheats, read the section <a class="xref" href="#A_Word_about__Cheating_" title="A Word about Cheating">Cheating </a>), in which case, you can select more modest playing levels.</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/48d8024f.png" align="middle" /></div><p>If you are a Snowie user, or have seen Snowie's analysis, you may wonder why my recommended level of play (Supremo) is set at 2-ply when Snowie's strongest setting is at 3-ply. The reason is simply one of nomenclature, or naming. Snowie starts counting at 1-ply whereas GNU starts at 0-ply, so the program's 2-ply is in fact the same search depth as Snowie's 3-ply.</p><div class="sect3" title="Move Filter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="Move_Filter"></a>Move Filter</h4></div></div></div><p>The move filter allows you to control exactly how many moves GNU is examining at each ply. A ply is basically one move played by one side, thus if both sides played a move, it would be one whole move, but two plies, one for each side. To change the specific settings, press the Modify... button.</p><p>Although the level presets, such as World Class, Supremo, etc. are tested and good, you may want to know or control how GNU filters its moves to analyze and how many. </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/e613071.png" align="middle" /></div><p>If you are playing Expert level (this is what GGRaccoon is set at) or another 0-ply setting, the Move Filter settings will not change a thing, as Expert level automatically examines all moves. At Supremo level, this changes though, as it takes a selection of the best moves from 0-ply and examines them at 2-ply. This means that for those selected moves it will calculate all the possibilities 2 plies ahead and evaluate them, allowing it to find better moves. Since Supremo is a 2-ply setting, we are only interested in the 2-ply settings of Large as in the figure above. 3-ply or 4-ply settings will have no effect here because Supremo doesn't examine at that depth. </p><p>In the figure above, we can see it first will Always accept 0 moves. This first line means that it won't force any moves to be analyzed at 2-ply, it will only analyze moves according to the second line. If it had said it would always analyze 2 moves, this would mean that no matter how ridiculously bad the 2nd move was compared to the 1st, it would analyze both at 2-ply. </p><p>The second line says it will Add extra 16 moves within 0.320. This means that provided they aren't more than 0.320 equity worse than the top move, it will select a maximum of 16 moves to analyze at 2-ply. For example, in the diagram below</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/m4149eeab.png" align="middle" /></div><p>the 2nd best move is no less than 0.453 equity worse than the top choice, so it didn't bother analyzing them at 2-ply as it is unlikely to change its mind on what the best move is. </p><p>Take a look at the figure below now:</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/m4ed24f10.png" align="middle" /></div><p>Here, the exact same settings were maintained, but the 1-ply filter was activated. This just means that those 16 moves selected from the 0-ply are sent instead to be analyzed at 1-ply, and then up to 5 moves from 1-ply will be sent to be analyzed at 2-ply. So this would actually be faster than the previous setting (and weaker), since a maximum of only 5 moves would be analyzed at 2-ply depth.</p><div class="tip" title="Tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Tip</h3><p>Feel free to experiment with the settings, as you can always reset them by simply choosing one of the level presets. One setting change I'd recommend is that of the 4-ply. The default setting only considers 2 moves if they are within 0.040 equity of each other. While I trust the program's analysis, there is often more than one move within that range, and I wouldn't want it to miss analyzing one because it is instructed to only look at two moves. I set the filter as in the diagram below: </p></div><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/4bd6c15f.png" align="middle" /></div><p>Before going any further, do not forget to click on Save settings at the bottom of the Settings menu.

                <p>Match Equity Tables</p>
                <p>The use and knowledge of Match Equity Tables, or METs, in match play is well understood by experienced players. If 25% is the limit to take a double in a money game, ignoring cube revig, in a match this changes enormously according to score. The most famous and popular MET is probably that by Kit Woolsey and Hal Heinrich. However, quite a number have been developed by notable players and researchers, each seeking to get a little closer to playing perfection. GNU allows you to select the MET of your choice, and also includes several you may not be familiar with, with mysterious names such as g11 or mec26. The first thing to realize is that the Woolsey/Heinrich table is based on a 20% gammon rate, and the bots have clearly shown by today that a more appropriate gammon rate is around 26-27%. Both the Rockwell-Kazaross, g11 and mec26 tables use such a rate, though Rockwell-Kazaross is probably the most precise, as the values up to a 15-point match were generated from extensive 2-ply rollouts by the program. For an expert opinion on the subject, allow me to refer to <a class="ulink" href="http://www.chicagopoint.com/abtalltime.html" target="_top">Neil Kazaross</a>, who wrote a <a class="ulink" href="http://www.bkgm.com/rgb/rgb.cgi?view+1187" target="_top">post</a> on this at the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gammonline.com/" target="_top">GammonLine</a> forum.</p>

Essentially what it does is allow you to see the possible consequences of a move or cube decision in a visual manner. It is available in the Analysis pane, and in the Hint window. The best way to understand this is to give an example. </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/3658e0e8.png" align="middle" /></div><p>Commenting on the position above, as can be seen in the Hint window below, GNU says that running off the anchor with 20/14 would lose 0.064 equity compared to the best move 6/5 6/1. </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/m2759b1ca.png" align="middle" /></div><p>It explains this to us through its estimated percentages of wins and losses, but even trusting the numbers, it is sometimes difficult for a player to see why one is worse than the other. This is a classic "pay now, pay later" situation, ideally suited for the Temperature Map. To see it I highlight the moves I want to compare, and then press the Temp. Map button. To select more than one move, keep the Ctrl key pressed and click on the moves you want to examine. Here is what it shows me:</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/2e6307ae.png" align="middle" /></div><p>The whiter the squares the worse the roll would be for me, and the darker the red, the better. We can see that after 20/14 there would be a number of possible rolls that would lead to disastrous situations compared to the ugly, but necessary 6/5 6/1. </p><p>If for example, you wanted to see why a certain roll, flagged with a white square, plays worse, you can click on Show best move, and the best move after each roll will appear in the corresponding square. Likewise, checking Show equities would show the resulting equities of each case scenario.</p><p>The Temperature Map is also available for cube decisions. Why cube decisions you might ask? The reason is that it allows you to see the volatility of the position, and would thus allow you to see quickly and easily the potential market losers of a position. You can set the depth of the analysis as seen at the bottom of the figure above, but be warned that even a 2-ply analysis of all the possibilities can take some time.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Importing and Exporting games"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="Importing_and_Exporting_games"></a>Importing and Exporting games</h2></div></div></div><p>GNU allows users to import matches from a variety of formats, including the Jellyfish formats, the FIBS oldmoves format, the Snowie GamesGrid format (.sgg), the TrueMoneyGames format (.tmg), and even Snowie's Standard Text Format among others.

There you can choose, down to the smallest details, what it will display and how. The <span class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> concerns the images used to produce board positions. This is chosen at the bottom of the window and you can choose between its own HTML images or two others, which are FIBS and BBS. </p><p>You can choose what the board in the HTML page will look like, and have it appear exactly as the board design (see <a class="xref" href="#Board_designs___2D_and_3D" title="Board designs &#8211; 2D and 3D">Board designs</a> for more on this) you are using in the program. To do so, you need to create a directory to place the images and then export them. First, go to the File menu, select Export, and then HTML Images... Find a directory to place them in, or create your own by pressing the Create Directory button at the top. I'd suggest using the default name \html-images. Now enter the directory and press the OK button. Be careful to remember the name of the directory you placed the images in, including capital letters if you used any. Now go to the Settings menu, select Export and then at the bottom select GNU Backgammon board images (circled in red below) and type the name of the directory. </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/29c6aa57.png" align="middle" /></div><div class="tip" title="Tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Tip</h3><p>If you want to post a position in an online forum that supports HTML you can do this regardless of whether the forum itself supports the necessary images.

Save the file and then open it in Internet Explorer. In case this already sounds a bit mysterious, inside IE just go to <span class="guimenu">File</span> &#8594; <span class="guimenuitem">Open...</span> and click on Browse... Locate the HTML file you saved and open it.</p><p>3) Once you see the board and image in front of you, still in IE, go to the View menu and select Source...

Go to Settings and select Analysis. A fairly large window will open, allowing you to play with as many settings as you could want. This is also where you set the thresholds for the Tutor mode (dubious, bad, etc.). Feel free to look around, but I simply set this to analyze checker play, cube decisions, and luck, and set the level of analysis at World Class for both checker play and cube decisions. The Move limit setting is to set the maximum number of moves it will display in the Hint window and the Analysis pane.</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/3b2e620f.png" align="middle" /></div><div class="tip" title="Tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Tip</h3><p>Once more, please do not forget to save (Settings|Save settings) after making changes in the settings, or you will be forced to change them again the next time you start the program.</p></div><p>If you just played a match at an online server, import it first, then go to the Analyze menu and select Analyze match.

Another feature (in my opinion) is that GNU only grades your checker play according to non-forced moves, contrary to Snowie which grades while including moves that were spent on the bar or that were forced. In other words, if you played 50 moves but 10 of those were spent on the bar (you can hardly make a mistake if you can't play), then GNU will average your error rate according to the 40 unforced moves. You can save these results with the match (<span class="guimenu">File</span> &#8594; <span class="guisubmenu">Save</span> &#8594; <span class="guimenuitem">Match</span>), so that you can see the analysis at anytime without having to redo it. If you are used to Snowie's grade system, or would like to compare them, you will see the equivalent Snowie grade at the top.</p><p>GNU can be quite tough on the grades, much harder than Snowie 4, so an Advanced grade in GNU could easily be an Expert or World Class grade in Snowie 4.

Remember you can set the limits of what is considered a mistake by GNU in the Analysis options in the Settings menu.</p><p>Here is a summary of what the colors and codes mean. The early versions of GNU didn't have the color coding, so they used punctuation marks, standard in chess notation, to describe the moves.</p><p>!? indicates a dubious move</p><p>? indicates a bad move, and</p><p>?? indicates a blunder</p><p>Since every move has two decisions involved, a checker play and a cube decision, one can make two mistakes in a single move, and thus see something like:</p><p>63: 24/15!???</p><p>Though it may seem like GNU got overly enthusiastic about its comments, the fact is there are two separate comments above. The first punctuation (!?) is for the checker play, and the second (??) is for the cube, so here a dubious checker play was made, and a cube decision blunder was also made.</p><p>Note that you can ignore this if you like, and stick to the color coding, as described below. If all this seems a bit disorienting at first, with a bit of practice, it will become second nature.</p><p>Green text indicates a dubious checker play</p><p>Blue text indicates a bad checker play</p><p>Red text indicates a very bad checker play</p><p>Grey background indicates a dubious cube decision</p><p>Purple background indicates a bad cube decision</p><p>Yellow background indicates a very bad cube decision</p><p>Boldface indicates a very lucky move</p><p>Italics indicates a very unlucky move</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Hint window &amp; Analysis pane"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="Hint_window__Analysis_pane"></a>Hint window &amp; Analysis pane</h3></div></div></div><p>You can see the program's analysis either in the Hint window by pressing the <img src="images/m6e32590b.png" /> button on the toolbar, or in the Analysis pane after a game or move has been analyzed (see <a class="xref" href="#Analyzing_matches" title="Analyzing matches">Analyzing matches</a> above).

In order to see it as shown below go to the Settings menu, select Options, then select the Display tab at the top. Set the last 3 choices as below:</p></div><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/m6fc19da0.png" align="middle" /></div><div class="sect3" title="Checker play analysis"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="Checker_play_analysis"></a>Checker play analysis</h4></div></div></div><p>A first suggestion is to go to the Settings menu, then Appearance, and in it, to the right, make sure the box for GWC as Percentage is checked. Here is what it shows for the dubious move shown above:</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/m2759b1ca.png" align="middle" /></div><p>First of all, if you are new to backgammon software, and the above looks hopelessly complicated, relax, it isn't nearly that bad. Let's look at the 5th line in red, the move that was played, and figure out what it all means:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Rank &#8211; As it's ranked 5th we know that GNU thinks it is only the 5th best move.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Type &#8211; It says Cubeful which means that it is taking into account the possibility that someone may double. This means that occasionally you may see several moves with an equity of -1.000 (see Equity below), despite significantly different winning percentiles, because it thinks that if they are played then the opponent will double, and you should pass. The 2-ply is the depth GNU analyzed the move.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Win - This number is the percentage the move has to win the game. Thus the move played gives the player a 29.7% chance to win (including gammons and backgammons). </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>W g - This number is the percentage of games that should win by at least a gammon (including backgammons). Thus you have a 0.7% of winning with a gammon or better.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>W bg &#8211; This number is the percentage of games that should win by a backgammon. Thus you have a 0.0% of winning with a backgammon.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Lose &#8211; This is the percentage of losses expected. Thus one has a 70.3% chance of losing the game (including gammons and backgammons). </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>L g - This number is the percentage of games that should lose by at least a gammon (including backgammons). Thus 8.1% of the games will lose by a gammon or worse.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>L bg - This number is the percentage of games that should end in backgammon losses. Thus 0.2% of the games will lose by a backgammon.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Equity &#8211; This is the overall evaluation of the position by the program, after considering the different win/loss percentiles, the cube position, and the match score. A 1.000 would mean that you are expected to win a point, a 0.000 would mean that it is roughly equal, and a -1.000 that you are expected to lose a point. The score shows an edge for the side that played as it says 0.137</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Diff. &#8211; This is the size of the error (the difference in equity) perceived in comparison to the top move. As we can see, the top move's equity reads 0.187 and the move played only 0.137, thus equating to a -0.050 error. The thresholds of the degrees of errors are determined in the Analysis settings. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Move &#8211; This is the move being evaluated. In the case of the red line, it is the move that was played.</p></li></ol></div><p>As you can see, it shows the best moves considered, with the move actually played in red, plus the various equity scores for gammons, etc. Most players will focus on the last three, which are the total equity of the move, the difference in equity between the move played and the program's top choice, and what move is being evaluated. However, since GNU can't explain why one move is better than another, looking at the win percentage, and the respective percentages of gammon wins and gammon losses can help.</p><p>That's all nice and well for the Hint window, however the Analysis pane, if activated, will appear below the Game Record a bit differently. If you don't see it at all, be sure it is activated in the View menu. Remember also that you must first have analyzed moves or games (<span class="guimenu">Analyze</span> &#8594; <span class="guimenuitem">Analyze match</span>) for it to display anything.</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/5308d35c.png" align="middle" /></div><p>The organization is similar to the Hint window described above, and the information is identical. The top line of each move shows the rank, the type (depth), the equity and the move played (in boldface). The line below shows the move's winning percentages, the gammon winning chances, and the backgammon percentages, followed by the respective percentages of the opponent. See above for a detailed description.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Cube analysis"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="Cube_analysis"></a>Cube analysis</h4></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/m1bd07579.png" align="middle" /></div><p>In the diagram above, you can see how its cube analysis looks like. First you will see that aside from the pure cubeless equity, it also says (Money: +0.357). The reason is that the cube analysis was from a match, where the score can completely change the value and correctness of a double or not, and GNU tells you what the equity would be if the decision were in a money game.</p><p>Below you can see the expected win/loss percentages, just as for checker play, and below that you can see the actual cube analysis. Here is what you are seeing:</p><p>1. Double, take +0.688 &#8211; This is the equity GNU estimates you will have if you double, and your opponent accepts. You will notice this is quite different from the cubeless equity at the top at +0.308. The reason is that this second equity of +0.688 takes into account the cube and power it gives. Since we know this is a match cube, the cube may have a very different value depending on how much it weighs on the match score.</p><p>2. Double, pass +1.000 +0.312 &#8211; The +1.000 is simply because if your opponent passes, you would win a single game (no gammon or backgammon) hence the +1.000 equity. Since this is considerably higher than your equity of +0.688 if he were to take, dropping the cube would be a +0.312 blunder (1000 &#8211; 688).</p><p>3. No double +0.646 -0.042 &#8211; This is what your equity would be if you didn't double. Since the equity is lower than the +0.688 you would have if you doubled and the double was accepted, not doubling would lose 0.042 (688 &#8211; 646), and would therefore be a mistake.</p><p>Proper cube action obviously represents what should be done on both sides, in other words you should double, since not doubling would be a 0.042 mistake as we saw, and your opponent should take, since dropping would be a 0.312 blunder.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Other analysis functions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="Other_analysis_functions"></a>Other analysis functions</h4></div></div></div><p>If you'd like to copy the analysis of a move(s) or cube decision to a document, highlight the moves that interest you, and press Copy. If you want to highlight more than one, keep the Ctrl key pressed while selecting the moves. Then paste it where you wish. Don't forget to change the font to Courier New size 9 or 10 if you wish to maintain the formatting.</p><p>If you'd like to see how the different moves it analyzed appear on the board, press the Show button. </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/m1921b4.png" align="middle" /></div><p>Now just click on a move you want to see in the list of analyzed moves and the board will display it. To see another move, just click on it. This allows you to quickly see and compare the moves it analyzed. To exit Show mode to be able to analyze the moves or run rollouts, click on the Show button again.</p><p>You'll also note a button called the Temp. Map <img src="images/m707a2772.png" />. This is a powerful tool conceived and developed by Sho Sengoku. Please refer to the <a class="xref" href="#Temperature_Map" title="Temperature Map">Temperature Map</a> section for details.</p><p>You may also want to have GNU analyze a few select moves a bit deeper. To do this you can have it go a 3rd ply, a 4th ply, or even do a rollout. To do a 3-ply or 4-ply analysis, select the moves you want analyzed, and then press the <img src="images/m22b92249.png" /> or <img src="images/3117171e.png" />. Let's have it do a 3-ply analysis of the three moves highlighted above. Just click on the number <span class="emphasis"><em>3</em></span> and it will do a 3-ply analysis. Be a little patient as 3 plies is considerably slower than 2 plies, but it shouldn't be too long. If you want to customize the evaluator, click on the button indicated with a small red circle <img src="images/m2a94f4ab.png" />, and change the parameters you want. Now just click on the Eval button, and let it compute its results. You may also prefer to see the Match Winning Chances of the moves instead of the equity.

A rollout is when you have the program play against itself a set amount of times (number of trials) and then sum up all the results of wins, losses, gammons, etc. from those games to give a more precise evaluation of a move/position. The interest is that the program may easily be underestimating some features/dangers of a position, and not realize this by only looking a couple of plies ahead. By playing it out, things will happen, and the game will unfold, giving it more accurate information on the consequences of a move. </p><p>One can do a full rollout, meaning it will play the position out until the last checker is born off, or it can be a truncated rollout, playing to a certain depth in plies, enough to evaluate the consequences, or even a mixture of settings. </p><p>Rollouts can be done at any time either directly from the Analysis pane with the Rollout option, or from the Hint window. To use the rollout function you must first select the moves you want to rollout, otherwise the button will remain grayed out and inaccessible. You will want to set your preferred options the first time by clicking on the <img src="images/m57625db1.png" /> button to the right of the Rollout button. </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/mb4b1284.png" align="middle" /></div><p>GNU offers a vast number of ways to set the rollouts, allowing you as many possibilities for efficiency as possible. Its 0-ply play is incredibly strong and practically instant, so it can help give meaningful results very quickly. GNU also plays according to score in its rollouts (using the match equity table of your choice naturally), which Snowie 4 does not for example. I will explain the main options, share the results of some of the testing that has been done, and share my preferences.</p><p>When one opens the rollout options window for the first time, it can look vastly intimidating and confusing. </p><p>
      <img src="images/2dd86698.png" />
    </p><p>However, it really isn't, so let's run through it from top to bottom and see what GNU can do for you.</p><div class="sect2" title="Playing strength"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="Playing_strength"></a>Playing strength</h3></div></div></div><p>To set the primary playing strength used in the rollouts, click on the tab First Play Both at the top:</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/m5781f59d.png" align="middle" /></div><p>This is where you configure the primary strength of play. If you want to set a different playing strength for the cube decisions, you must go to the General Settings tab and at the bottom deactivate the option Cube decisions use same settings as Checker play.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Trials"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="Trials"></a>Trials</h3></div></div></div><p>The topmost part under the tab General Settings is where you set the number of trials.</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/m4796afa7.png" align="middle" /></div><p>The number of trials is simply the number of games you want GNU to play out (or roll out) as it collects the results. The more trials the better as this reduces the error margin of the results. After all, if it won a certain position 2 times in 3, it could be a fluke, but after hundreds or thousands of trials with variance reduction (see below) the results become far more trustworthy.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Truncated rollouts"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="Truncated_rollouts"></a>Truncated rollouts</h3></div></div></div><p>Truncated rollouts are rollouts played to a certain number of moves as opposed to full rollouts. You may feel that the program doesn't really need to play the game to the last move to know whether a move leads to good positions or bad ones.</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/m19f9a2cc.png" align="middle" /></div><p>In the above figure the setting is 11 plies, so GNU will play out 11 moves, stop and evaluate the resulting position, and then start the next trial. This is far faster of course, and is particularly desirable if you want to analyze using a 2-ply playing strength which might be too slow for a full rollout.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Evaluation for later plies"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="Evaluation_for_later_plies"></a>Evaluation for later plies</h3></div></div></div><p>One can set GNU to use a different playing strength after a specified number of plies in the Evaluation for later plies.</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/3cb4011e.png" align="middle" /></div><p>For example, suppose you had a backgame situation to rollout. Although you wanted the game to be rolled out at 0-ply (1900-2000 Elo), you didn't trust the first plies to be the best. Enabling this as above, you could set the first 8 plies to be played at Supremo (2-ply) and the rest of the game at 0-ply, giving you a bit of both worlds. In fact this has been tested and shown to be very efficient for exactly that type of scenario.</p><p>So how does one set the playing strength of the first 5 plies (for example) and after? At the top, there are those mysterious tabs: </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/4e43baf8.png" align="middle" /></div><p>If you click on the tab First Play Both, you can set the strength of the first plies to be played. Naturally, if you haven't activated the Evaluation for later plies option this will be the default rollout playing strength. Now, once you have set this, click on the Later Play Both, and you will be able to set the playing strength for the subsequent plies. You can use this option in both full rollouts and truncated rollouts. </p></div><div class="sect2" title="Stop at specific Standard Deviation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="Stop_at_specific_Standard_Deviation"></a>Stop at specific Standard Deviation</h3></div></div></div><p>Obviously, a rollout with too few trials will not yield reliable results due to the large Standard Deviation, or in other words how much the result could be wrong by. The more trials the smaller the possible error, however how many trials are necessary? Unfortunately, this can vary a lot according to the position, so to get a Standard Deviation of 0.020 (meaning the equity given could be actually 0.020 more or 0.020 less) one position might need 400 trials, and another might need 1400. This option is designed to address this problem.</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/m23e0471c.png" align="middle" /></div><p>In the figure above, the rollout was set to stop when the standard deviation of the equity is less than 0.01 and a minimum of 144 games were requested. </p></div><div class="sect2" title="Stop at specific Joint Standard Deviation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="Stop_at_specific_Joint_Standard_Deviation"></a>Stop at specific Joint Standard Deviation</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">When comparing the results of two plays, each of which has an associated random uncertainty (standard deviation), a 'joint standard deviation' needs to be calculated.

If s1 and s2 are close (which is almost always the case in backgammon rollouts where the same number of trials were used for each play), this simplifies to s*sqrt(2) = 1.4*s.</span>&#8221;</span> (Chuck Bower, <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gammonline.com/members/Jan01/articles/uncert.htm" target="_top">Understanding Uncertainty</a>, 2001)</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/m30dc13f6.png" align="middle" /></div><p>This option allows you to set a rollout to stop when a specific j.s.d. has been reached to compare two moves.

                <p>Variance Reduction</p>
                <p>Whenever running a rollout, you will always want the Variance Reduction activated as it greatly increases the reliability of the results. The first time this ingenious <a class="ulink" href="http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~drhoover/SIMULATIONR.PDF" target="_top">technique</a> was introduced to backgammon rollouts was by Fredrik Dahl, the author of Jellyfish. In a nutshell, it factors in luck when evaluating results, so that the program doesn't need 10,000 games to average out the luck of the dice and that way ensure luck wasn't a factor in the results obtained. With it, 100 rolled out games with Variance Reduction can be the equivalent of 5,000 games with no Variance Reduction.</p>

The reason is that luck may cause a number of flukes to happen, especially in the first roll. What if in your trials, the first roll it played never included some numbers which might lead to a slight change in its evaluation? The variance reduction will compensate for this, but so does the option to use quasi-random dice.</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/4332f3e4.png" align="middle" /></div><p>This option deliberately alternates the first roll for every trial so that every possible first roll will have been played after 36 trials, starting with 1 and 1, then 1 and 2, all the way to 6 and 6. The idea is to help negate the luck in the rollouts a bit more. However, this also means that if used, one must use a number of trials that is a multiple of 36. That is why 1296 trials (or 2592 or 3888) is a good number to run rollouts as it is 36 x 36.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Rollout as initial position"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="Rollout_as_initial_position"></a>Rollout as initial position</h3></div></div></div><p>If you plan to do a rollout on one of the opening moves you will want to activate the option Rollout as initial position.</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/74a66417.png" align="middle" /></div><p>The reason is that in the opening move one is not allowed to roll a double.

Without this option, the tabs First Play Both and Later Play Both establish the playing strength for both sides. With it, they only determine the playing strength of the first player.

For example, you might be content to let it play 17 plies at 0-ply to evaluate the resulting position, but want a little more precision on the evaluation of the final position. You can change this by deactivating the Use player0 setting for truncation point.</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/m3eb29fd9.png" align="middle" /></div><p>When deactivated, you can set a different playing level for that final evaluation.

I'd like to especially thank Michael Depreli, Ian Shaw, Ian Dunstan and Neil Kazaross for their painstaking research and the huge amount of computer time spent gathering and processing the data. The results helped answer a number of questions that reflect in my choice settings.</p><p>The first thing to note is that the 0-ply checker play is indeed extremely strong (as any victim of GGRaccoon can attest to) and due to its speed is usually ideal for full rollouts. It is only less than ideal for backgame situations, prime vs. prime situations, and positions where timing is an important consideration. So for pretty much any other situation, it can be used confidently. There has been significant questioning of the odd-ply play as it has often been seen that 1-ply would produce erratic results. Tests have shown that this is true of cube decision, but 1-ply checker play is a bit stronger than 0-ply as one would expect.</p><p>The primary setting is what I use the most and covers 95% of my rollouts, giving excellent results within a few minutes.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>My primary setting: </p></li></ol></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="a"><li class="listitem"><p>Set the number of games to either 648 games or 1296 using the arrows on the right.

To remove or add white checkers to a point for example, use the right mouse button and click on the point. You determine the number of checkers to be added or removed by the height of the point you press. For example, in the following diagram, </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/6a6ae1b7.png" align="middle" /></div><p>if you have 5 white checkers on the 19-point and only want to have 3, click with the right mouse button on the 3rd checker where the yellow arrow indicates and the top two will be removed. Adding checkers is the same, so if you wanted to add a red checker to the 6-point you would place the cursor where the green arrow indicates and left-click. If you want to quickly get the starting position, you can click on the area indicated by the blue ellipses on the left, and if you want to quickly clear the board of all checkers, click instead on the right side on the area indicated by the pink ellipses. Try it and experiment a little. It's much easier to do than to explain.</p><p>Once the position is set up, press the Edit button again to exit Edit mode. Now just go to the Analyze menu and select Hint (suggested even for rollouts). Attention, this isn't a suggestion, you must exit the Edit mode before asking for GNU to evaluate the position otherwise you will get odd results.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Appearance"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Skins"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="Skins"></a>Skins</h3></div></div></div><p>You can change the overall appearance of the menus through a number of skins included with the installation, however this cannot be done from within the program and must done manually. The procedure is fairly painless if you aren't afraid of moving a couple of files in the Windows Explorer. </p><p>Open Windows Explorer, and enter the \Program Files\gnubg directory. In it there is a directory called \Themes, where the skins are located, and in that, you will see a number of directories with the names of the skins they contain. Enter the directory you want and copy the files in it to the main \gnubg directory. It will ask you if you want to overwrite the files in it. Say yes, and start GNU to see the changes. It is important to copy and not move the files, so if you're not Windows savvy, this means holding the Ctrl key on the keyboard down while dragging the files. Keep the Ctrl key pressed when you let go of the mouse button.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Board designs &#8211; 2D and 3D"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="Board_designs___2D_and_3D"></a>Board designs &#8211; 2D and 3D</h3></div></div></div><p>The appearance of the boards can also be changed making use of a number of presets, or you can design your own.

It is also an engine that is stronger than its older top-of-the-line siblings in GamesGrid, and at its price (free), one would have to be crazy not to have it, even if one does own the legendary Snowie. After all, two heads are better than one. </p><p>I would like to effusively thank the authors of GNU Backgammon and its numerous contributors, and would also like to suggest that anyone enjoying their efforts make a contribution to the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.fsf.org/" target="_top">Free Software Foundation</a> (FSF), the principal organizational sponsor of the GNU Project, as a token of appreciation. The FSF survives mostly off the contributions, however small, of private donations, and without it, those loud complaints mentioned above would be entirely justified. </p></div><div class="sect1" title="A Word about Cheating"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="A_Word_about__Cheating_"></a>A Word about <span class="emphasis"><em>Cheating</em></span></h2></div></div></div><p>By far, the most common complaint seen about all backgammon software, weak or strong, is that it must be cheating to get so lucky. Most of these complaints stem from a lack of understanding of probabilities, and how skillful play will affect luck or the possibility of lucky rolls. </p><p>To begin with, let it be stated that there is no bias of any kind, and the source code of GNU is open to any doubting it. If you still cannot believe it, feel free to use your own dice by entering the Settings menu and selecting Options, and then in the right side Manual dice. If you are rigorously honest about your results, you will find no difference in the long run.</p><p>Probabilities are what rule supreme in backgammon. As there is indeed an uncontrollable luck factor, one cannot guarantee a victory or loss no matter how stacked up the chances are. So, good backgammon strategy is designed to maximize the good rolls for the playing side, and minimize the good rolls for the other side. In other words, after the best play, there will be fewer good rolls for the other side. If the other side doesn't realize what is happening, then it will seem like a never-ending streak of bad luck. It's not; it's the consequence of good playing. GNU is among the very best, so use it and learn with it. You can set it at a much weaker setting, and watch how its luck dries up.</p><p>The mathematics behind probabilities are also usually very poorly understood. Take for example the situation below. If your opponent had a checker on the bar, what is his chance of entering that single point?</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/m634daa5.png" align="middle" /></div><p>If you said 11 chances in 36 or a little over 30%, good for you, but if you said 1 in 6 then you need a little brushing up. 1 in 6 would be correct if your opponent were only using one die, but with two, the chances add up to 11 in 36. So how come you never enter and GNU does? It may seem like that at times, but it's really not the case. It is natural to focus more on what causes us anguish making reality look quite distorted, but maybe you were very unlucky. Stories of hard luck abound. In a live game, I once played my opening move, and then lost to a backgammon without ever playing another move. My opponent hit me, and I danced for the rest of the game. I wasn't even able to avoid a backgammon. A top professional once told me of an instance where he was giving a gammon, got hit, and lost after dancing 7 straight times against a 3-point board. Does it seem to get more doubles? What about those doubles you rolled while on the bar? They don't count, you say? Sorry, but lady luck makes no case of guaranteeing the double will arrive at the right time. Good strategy will help you be able to use it when it does arrive.</p></div><div xml:lang="en" class="appendix" title="A. GNU Free Documentation License" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="legal"></a>A. GNU Free Documentation License</h2></div></div></div><p>Version 1.3, 3 November 2008</p><p>

    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
    license document, but changing it is not allowed.
  </p><h3><a id="section0"></a>
    0. PREAMBLE
  </h3><p>
    The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
    functional and useful document &#8220;free&#8221; in the sense of freedom:
    to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with
    or without modifying it, either commercially or
    noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and
    publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered
    responsible for modifications made by others.
  </p><p>
    This License is a kind of &#8220;copyleft&#8221;, which means that
    derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same
    sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
    license designed for free software.
  </p><p>
    We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
    software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program
    should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software
    does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used
    for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is
    published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for
    works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
  </p><h3><a id="section1"></a>
    1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
  </h3><p>
    This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
    distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
    world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work
    under the conditions stated herein. The &#8220;Document&#8221;, below,
    refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee,
    and is addressed as &#8220;you&#8221;. You accept the license if you copy,
    modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under
    copyright law.
  </p><p>
    A &#8220;Modified Version&#8221; of the Document means any work containing
    the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
    modifications and/or translated into another language.
  </p><p>
    A &#8220;Secondary Section&#8221; is a named appendix or a front-matter
    section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of
    the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document&#8217;s overall
    subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
    directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a
    textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
    mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection
    with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
    philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
  </p><p>
    The &#8220;Invariant Sections&#8221; are certain Secondary Sections whose
    titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
    that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section
    does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to
    be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant
    Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then
    there are none.
  </p><p>
    The &#8220;Cover Texts&#8221; are certain short passages of text that are
    listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says
    that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may
    be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
  </p><p>
    A &#8220;Transparent&#8221; copy of the Document means a machine-readable
    copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the
    general public, that is suitable for revising the document
    straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
    pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
    drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
    automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
    formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
    markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage
    subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is
    not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is
    not &#8220;Transparent&#8221; is called &#8220;Opaque&#8221;.
  </p><p>
    Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
    without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML
    using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
    PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent
    image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary
    formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors,
    SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
    available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by
    some word processors for output purposes only.
  </p><p>
    The &#8220;Title Page&#8221; means, for a printed book, the title page
    itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
    material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in
    formats which do not have any title page as such, &#8220;Title Page&#8221;
    means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work&#8217;s
    title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
  </p><p>
    The &#8220;publisher&#8221; means any person or entity that distributes
    copies of the Document to the public.
  </p><p>
    A section &#8220;Entitled XYZ&#8221; means a named subunit of the Document
    whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
    following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands
    for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
    &#8220;Acknowledgements&#8221;, &#8220;Dedications&#8221;,
    &#8220;Endorsements&#8221;, or &#8220;History&#8221;.) To &#8220;Preserve
    the Title&#8221; of such a section when you modify the Document means that
    it remains a section &#8220;Entitled XYZ&#8221; according to this
    definition.
  </p><p>
    The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
    states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
    Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
    but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
    these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
    meaning of this License.
  </p><h3><a id="section2"></a>
    2. VERBATIM COPYING
  </h3><p>
    You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
    commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright
    notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the
    Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
    conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical
    measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the
    copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in
    exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you
    must also follow the conditions in section 3.
  </p><p>
    You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you
    may publicly display copies.
  </p><h3><a id="section3"></a>
    3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
  </h3><p>
    If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
    printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
    Document&#8217;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
    the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
    Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the
    back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
    publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title
    with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
    other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to
    the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy
    these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.
  </p><p>
    If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
    you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the
    actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
  </p><p>
    If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
    than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy
    along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
    computer-network location from which the general network-using public has
    access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete
    Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the
    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
    distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent
    copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
    year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
    through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
  </p><p>
    It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
    Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
    them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
  </p><h3><a id="section4"></a>
    4. MODIFICATIONS
  </h3><p>
    You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
    conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the
    Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version
    filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and
    modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In
    addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
  </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="A"><li class="listitem">
        Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
        from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which
        should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the
        Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the
        original publisher of that version gives permission.
      </li><li class="listitem">
        List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities

        Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
        unless they release you from this requirement.

        Page. If there is no section Entitled &#8220;History&#8221; in the
        Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher
        of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item
        describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.

        based on.  These may be placed in the &#8220;History&#8221;
        section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published
        at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
        publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

        Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
      </li></ol></div><p>
    If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
    that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
    Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections
    as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant
    Sections in the Modified Version&#8217;s license notice. These titles
    must be distinct from any other section titles.
  </p><p>
    You may add a section Entitled &#8220;Endorsements&#8221;, provided it
    contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
    parties &#8212; for example, statements of peer review or that the text
    has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
    standard.
  </p><p>
    You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
    passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of
    Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text
    and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made
    by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the
    same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same
    entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
    replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher
    that added the old one.
  </p><p>
    The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
    permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
    endorsement of any Modified Version.
  </p><h3><a id="section5"></a>
    5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
  </h3><p>
    You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
    License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
    provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections
    of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as
    Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that
    you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
  </p><p>
    The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
    identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there
    are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents,
    make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in
    parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section
    if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section
    titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
    combined work.
  </p><p>
    In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
    &#8220;History&#8221; in the various original documents, forming one
    section Entitled &#8220;History&#8221;; likewise combine any sections
    Entitled &#8220;Acknowledgements&#8221;, and any sections Entitled
    &#8220;Dedications&#8221;. You must delete all sections Entitled
    &#8220;Endorsements&#8221;.
  </p><h3><a id="section6"></a>
    6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
  </h3><p>
    You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
    released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
    License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
    the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
    verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
  </p><p>
    You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
    it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
    License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other
    respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
  </p><h3><a id="section7"></a>
    7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
  </h3><p>
    A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
    independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
    distribution medium, is called an &#8220;aggregate&#8221; if the copyright
    resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of
    the compilation&#8217;s users beyond what the individual works
    permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does
    not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
    derivative works of the Document.
  </p><p>
    If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies
    of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire
    aggregate, the Document&#8217;s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that
    bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of
    covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear
    on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.
  </p><h3><a id="section8"></a>
    8. TRANSLATION
  </h3><p>
    Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
    translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing
    Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from
    their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all
    Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant
    Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the
    license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided
    that you also include the original English version of this License and the
    original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a
    disagreement between the translation and the original version of this
    License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
  </p><p>
    If a section in the Document is Entitled &#8220;Acknowledgements&#8221;,
    &#8220;Dedications&#8221;, or &#8220;History&#8221;, the requirement
    (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require
    changing the actual title.
  </p><h3><a id="section9"></a>
    9. TERMINATION
  </h3><p>
    You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as
    expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
    modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically
    terminate your rights under this License.
  </p><p>
    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
    from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless
    and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your
    license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you
    of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the
    cessation.
  </p><p>
    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
    permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
    reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of
    violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and
    you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
  </p><p>
    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
    licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this
    License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
    reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not
    give you any rights to use it.
  </p><h3><a id="section10"></a>
    10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
  </h3><p>
    The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU
    Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be
    similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
    address new problems or concerns. See
    <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/" target="_top">Copyleft</a>.
  </p><p>
    Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If
    the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License
    &#8220;or any later version&#8221; applies to it, you have the option of
    following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of
    any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free
    Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of
    this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft)
    by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy
    can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
    proxy&#8217;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
    authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.
  </p><h3><a id="section11"></a>
    11. RELICENSING
  </h3><p>
    &#8220;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&#8221; (or &#8220;MMC
    Site&#8221;) means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable
    works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those
    works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a
    server. A &#8220;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&#8221; (or
    &#8220;MMC&#8221;) contained in the site means any set of copyrightable
    works thus published on the MMC site.
  </p><p>
    &#8220;CC-BY-SA&#8221; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike
    3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
    corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
    California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published
    by that same organization.
  </p><p>
    &#8220;Incorporate&#8221; means to publish or republish a Document, in
    whole or in part, as part of another Document.
  </p><p>
    An MMC is &#8220;eligible for relicensing&#8221; if it is licensed under
    this License, and if all works that were first published under this
    License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in
    whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant
    sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.
  </p><p>
    The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
    under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
    provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

    ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
  </h3><p>
    To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the
    License in the document and put the following copyright and license
    notices just after the title page:
  </p><pre class="screen">Copyright © YEAR YOUR NAME

Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the
terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no
Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in
the section entitled &#8220;GNU Free Documentation License&#8221;.</pre><p>
    If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
    replace the &#8220;with&#8230; Texts.&#8221; line with this:
  </p><pre class="screen">with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts
being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.</pre><p>
    If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
    combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
    situation.
  </p><p>
    If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
    recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
    software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their
    use in free software.
