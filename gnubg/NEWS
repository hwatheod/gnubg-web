* Changes in GNU Backgammon 0.13

** swap players
*** new command "swap players" (also available from the menu Game->Swap Players)
   that swaps the players. Useful when your match imported from, e.g., 
   GamesGrid is "upside-down".

   fish book.
   Also, a new command "set invert met on|off" to specify whether the table
   should be used as entered, or used inverted. For example, the supplied METs
   from Jacobs and Trice's book are entered with player 0 being the 
   stronger player.  If the table should be used with player 1 being the 
   stronger player use: "set invert met on".

** Rollouts:
*** rollout positions as initial position (i.e., no doubles on first roll).
*** quasi-random dice added.

*** standard errors are now shown in equity or mwc according to user
   settings.

** External players (where moves are read from a socket to another process)
added.

** Importing of JF ".pos" position files added.

** Added Guile support, if Guile is available.

** Allow "=n" notation for moves (e.g. "eval =1" evaluates the position
after gnubg's first choice move is played; "rollout =1 =3" rolls out the
best and 3rd best moves).

** Generate an in-memory heuristic bearoff database if it can't be read
from the filesystem.

** .SGF format support for loading and saving added.

** Added game and match navigation: use `next' and `previous' commands,

moves will be recognised.

** The player names now default to the user's login name and "gnubg".

** Added --no-weights option to disable reading weights files.  Generate
and use binary weight files if available.
