<h1>Getting started</h1>
To get started, click on "New money session" or "New match".  For the latter, you will be prompted for the match length.
<br><br>
When it's your turn, if you can double, then you will need to click "Roll" or "Double".  Otherwise, the dice will be rolled for you
automatically.
<br><br>
For now, moves must be entered manually in the box labelled "Move or gnubg command".  Moves are entered in standard
backgammon notation, e.g., 8/5 6/5. 
<br>
You don't need to indicate hits with a *.  Bar may be entered as "bar" or "b",
and when bearing off, the target may be "off" or "0".
<br><br>
If the computer doubles you, a cube with the new value will appear in the middle of the right side of the board.
You should click "Accept", "Reject", or "Beaver" (no beavers in a match).
<br><br>
If the computer offers a resignation, a flag will appear with the value that the computer is offering (1=single, 2=gammon,
3=backgammon). You should click "Accept" or "Reject".
<br><br>
The bottom of the screen shows the logs from GNU Backgammon, but for normal play, you should not need to look at it.

<h1>More advanced GNU Backgammon commands</h1>
Nearly all GNU Backgammon commands work in this web version.  Type "help" in the command box to get a complete list.
<br><br>
If the command produces output, like "hint" or "eval", it will be shown in the logs at the bottom of the screen.
<br><br>
Some commands may take a long time, like "analyze" or (especially) "rollout".  It is not recommended to do rollouts
 with this web interface, although technically it works.  
<br>
You will not be able to interrupt a long command, and that tab in your browser will be frozen while it runs.
<br>You'll know the command is complete when you see the command appear in the logs at the bottom of the screen (e.g. as "=> analyze match").
<br>Your browser may detect a long-running task and offer to 
 let you interrupt it.  But if you interrupt from the browser, your session will be lost and you'll need to reload 
 the page and start over.
<br><br>
Importing and exporting files are a 2-step process:
<br><br>
To export, first type the gnubg export command, for example "export game gam mygame.gam".  
<br>Then, download the file to your local machine by clicking "Download" and entering
 the name of the file (in this case mygame.gam).
<br><br>
To import, first click "Upload" and select the file from your local machine, then type the appropriate gnubg import command.
