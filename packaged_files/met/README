This directory contains 

* XML files with match equity tables for use with GNU Backgammon. You may
  add your own for use with GNU Backgammon. If you think your table has
  public interest and you would like to have it included in the GNU Backgammon
  distribution, please mail it to <bug-gnubg@gnu.org>.

* the Document Type Definition (DTD) for the match equity tables (met.dtd),

* a stylesheet file for converting match equity XML files to HTML files;

  The style sheet (met.xsl) can be used to convert the match equity XML files
  to HTML with any XSLT processor, for example xsltproc from the libxml2 
  package:

  % xsltproc -o woolsey.html met.xsl woolsey.xml
